Justification: Based on available information about then-Congressman Andy Barr's voting record, it is possible that he supported policies favorable to payday lenders, which could potentially impact troops negatively. However, without specifically referring to a piece of legislation or voting record, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Justification: Based on information available up to September 10, 2018, it appears that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who served as part of the Trump administration, had previously expressed support for payday lenders during his time as a senator. However, I cannot confirm directly if Barr, who later served as Attorney General, explicitly supported payday lenders during his tenure, as this question pertains to a specific time period after the given date. It would be necessary to examine sources from that period to accurately answer this question.

Justification: Based on information available prior to September 10, 2018, it has been reported that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who served as the head of the Department of Justice under the same name as the individual mentioned in your question (Barr), made comments that were seen as supportive of payday lending. These comments were made during a Community Financial Services Association event, where Sessions expressed his concerns about potential overregulation of the payday lending industry. Although I cannot confirm that the individual in question (Barr) held the same views, it is reasonable to assume that the Barr you are asking about may have had similar sentiments, given the shared name and the context of the information available. However, I emphasize that my confidence is medium due to the necessary assumption made regarding the individual in question.

Justification: In 2014, Senator Barr (assuming you are referring to Senator Barbara Barr, as there is no Senator Barr in history) voted against an amendment that aimed to protect military service members from predatory payday lending practices. The amendment was part of the National Defense Authorization Act, and it sought to limit the interest rates that lenders could charge active-duty military personnel. The intention was to shield service members from financial exploitation. By voting against this amendment, Senator Barr could be seen as voting against the interests of the military with regards to payday lending.

Justification: Based on information available prior to September 10, 2018, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who served until November 7, 2018, was part of the Trump administration, which generally supported the payday lending industry. As the head of the Department of Justice, Sessions, and by extension, the Department, indirectly supported payday lending through the administration's policies and deregulatory efforts. However, it is difficult to determine the specific stance of then-Attorney General Sessions on payday lending, as he did not make any public statements on the matter that I could find. Therefore, I infer that he likely supported payday lending through his association with the administration.

Justification: Based on available information prior to September 10, 2018, Senator Barr (R-NE) generally opposed regulations on financial institutions. In 2015, he voted against an amendment that would have allowed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to regulate payday lending, which suggests that he likely voted against laws that would have regulated payday lending as well. However, I cannot provide a definitive answer without knowing the specific law in question.

If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you could make a lot of money." Although this statement does not directly reference the 2008 housing crash, it does align with the idea of benefiting from a real estate market downturn.

Justification: Yes, there are studies that indicate global warming poses a threat to national security. These threats can manifest in various ways, such as increased instances of extreme weather events resulting in infrastructure damage, disruptions to agricultural production, and potential conflicts over increasingly scarce resources. Climate change can also exacerbate existing social and economic issues, further straining security resources. These factors have led some experts to classify global warming as a national security concern.

Justification: People cannot simply walk up to a port of entry and claim a credible fear of persecution to gain entry into a country, including the United States. There is a specific process in place for handling such claims, which involves an interview with a trained asylum officer to determine the validity of the claim. If the fear is deemed credible, the individual may be allowed to remain in the country temporarily while their asylum case is processed. However, this does not mean they will be granted asylum; it simply allows them to proceed with the necessary legal steps.

Justification: Yes, individuals who claim credible fear at ports of entry are generally brought in for processing.

This process is in accordance with international law, specifically the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, to which the United States is a party.

By February 2020, the practice had been reduced by about 95% compared to its peak in 2011.

Justification: Measles is a highly contagious virus that is primarily spread through direct contact with an infected person's respiratory droplets, which can be released into the air when they cough or sneeze. It is possible to contract measles if you are in the same room as an infected person, but it typically requires much closer and more immediate exposure than just being in the same room a few hours apart. The virus can remain airborne for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area, but the risk of infection decreases significantly over time. Therefore, it is unlikely that you would catch measles from another person if you enter a room a few hours after they have left.
