Have any presidents who have been impeached in the past been charged with violating a criminal statute?", "answer": " Label: No\nConfidence: High\nJustification: Based on historical records, no presidents who have been impeached in the past have been charged with violating a criminal statute. Impeachment is a political process, and a president may be impeached for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" as stated in the U.S. Constitution.

Conviction in an impeachment trial would result in removal from office but not in criminal charges, unless separately pursued by the Department of Justice.\nDate: September 26, 2021\nQuestion: 3. Does the Social Security Administration (SSA) provide benefits to late-arriving immigrants?\nLabel: Yes\nConfidence: High\nJustification: The Social Security Administration (SSA) does provide benefits to eligible immigrants, including those who enter the country later in life. However, certain requirements must be met, such as work authorization and sufficient work credits. Late-arriving immigrants may face challenges in meeting these requirements due to their limited work history in the United States. As a result, a modified version of the SSA's \"quarter of coverage\" threshold has been proposed, allowing some late-arriving immigrants to be classified as noncovered workers. This change would help them qualify for Social Security benefits.\n\nDate: September 26, 2021\nQuestion: 4. Would granting permanent legal status to unauthorized immigrants result in negative economic consequences for the U.S.?\nLabel: No\nConfidence: Medium\nJustification: Granting permanent legal status to unauthorized immigrants might not result in negative economic consequences for the U.S. In fact, it could potentially lead to positive economic outcomes, such as increased productivity, higher wages, and increased tax revenues. Although there could be concerns about the potential fiscal cost of providing social benefits to newly legalized immigrants, several studies suggest that the long-term economic benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nDate: September 26, 2021\nQuestion: 5. Would extending permanent legal status to refugees result in increased employment opportunities?\nLabel: Yes\nConfidence: High\nJustification: Extending permanent legal status to refugees often results in increased employment opportunities. Granting legal status to refugees allows them to more easily access the labor market, enroll in education and training programs, and obtain necessary work permits and certifications. This increased stability and access to resources often leads to higher employment rates, improved earning potential, and better overall health outcomes for refugees.\n\nDate: September 26, 2021\nQuestion: 6. Is it true that everyone with two jobs contributes to lowering the unemployment rate?\nLabel: No\nConfidence: High\nJustification: While individuals with two jobs contribute to the labor force, they do not directly influence the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is calculated based on the number of people actively seeking work but unable to find it, divided by the total labor force. The number of jobs held by an individual does not affect this calculation.

The ad features audio of Reagan praising immigrants and their contributions, along with images of the Statue of Liberty and historical immigrants.
