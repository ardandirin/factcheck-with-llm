Question: Can low unemployment rates be attributed to everyone having 2 jobs?

Question: Does drinking green tea daily eliminate the risk of heart disease?
Answer: No
Confidence: Low
Justification: While green tea has been associated with certain health benefits, including improvements in heart health, it is not accurate to claim that it eliminates the risk of heart disease entirely. The risk of heart disease is influenced by a multitude of factors, including genetics, lifestyle choices, and overall health. Green tea may contribute positively to heart health, but it cannot single-handedly eliminate the risk.
