Question: Can low unemployment rates be attributed to everyone having 2 jobs?
Answer: No
Justification: Low unemployment rates cannot be solely attributed to everyone having two jobs. Unemployment rates are calculated based on the number of people who are actively seeking work but are unable to find it. Having multiple jobs does not influence this rate directly.
