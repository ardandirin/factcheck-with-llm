Drafted by Bundy . According to the President 's Daily Diary , the meeting lasted from 5:08 to 6:03 p.m. ( Johnson Library ) Prior to this meeting , Marcos met with McNamara at the Pentagon from 4 to 4:30 p.m. A memorandum of their conversation by McNaughton , September 15 , I-1307066 , is in the Washington National Records Center , RG 330 , OASD/ISA Files : FRC 70 A 6648 , Philippines 00.1 -- 333 . SUBJECTFinal Conversation Between President Johnson and President Marcos ( This memorandum was prepared by Mr. Bundy and cleared by Mr. Rostow . Since it has not been personally seen by the President , and in view of the sensitivity of the discussion at some points , it should be used solely for working reference , and its distribution is being limited to the following on an Eyes Only basis : Secretary Rusk , Secretary Fowler , Secretary McNamara , Mr. Ball , Mr. Rostow , and Mr. Bundy . A copy will also be given to Ambassador Blair for his personal use on his return . ) Present were : President Johnson , Mr. Ball , Mr. Rostow , Ambassador Blair , and Mr. Bundy . President Marcos , Secretary Ramos , Secretary Romualdez , Secretary Umali , Mr. Aspiras , Dr. Mapa , and General Menzi . 1 . Stabilization credit . The President explained the reasons why the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury could not agree either to a general undertaking to support the peso or to a specific stabilization credit . He pointed out that we had never given an undertaking of support for any foreign currency , and that we had extended stabilization credits only in a multilateral framework involving the IMF . To depart from these principles would be a serious problem in our relations with other countries./2/ The President and Mr. Bundy also argued that the peso was now in sound shape Both Treasury and State opposed standby credit for the Philippines from the Exchange Stabilization Fund . Such assistance should only be used in conjunction with financial support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank . ( Johnson Library , National Security File , Country File , Philippines , Marcos Visit Papers , Memos , 9/14-16/66 ) President Marcos and Secretary Romualdez argued that , while the peso was in sound shape , there were many speculators who were contending that the expenditures under the Marcos program would lead to inflation . In light of President Johnson 's position , there was some discussion whether the paragraph should be retained with general language as proposed on the American side . President Johnson finally asked whether the paragraph was necessary , and made clear that it was not important from a US standpoint . President Marcos , in consultation with Secretary Romualdez , finally suggested that the paragraph be dropped altogether , and this was accepted./3/ /3/he text of the communiqu\u00e9 as released is printed in Department of State Bulletin , October 10 , 1966 , pp . 531-534 and American Foreign Policy : Current Documents , 1966 , pp . 726-730 . 2 . Offshore procurement./4/ President Johnson explained that the creation of a special committee would appear to give favored status to the Philippines , and that this would cause us embarrassment in other countries . He urged acceptance of our draft language . /4/William Bundy sent Johnson a memorandum , September 15 , recommending the positions on offshore procurement and the rest of the issues discussed at this meeting . ( Johnson Library , National Security File , Memos to the President , Walt Rostow , Vol . 13 , 9/15-30/66 ) President Marcos did not press for the special committee , but did ask for a reference to a `` procurement office . `` Mr. Bundy explained that the DOD simply had to keep the executive responsibility for Far East procurement in Tokyo , and that a separate action office in Manila would be inefficient . Mr. Bundy noted that the present Procurement Information Office should provide full information , and was closely wired to the Tokyo action office . Thus , with the assurance of participation on a `` full and equitable basis , `` we believed we were going as far as we could . President Marcos said that the problem was that a lot of Philippine sales under the program were now going through middlemen in Hong Kong and elsewhere , who had better information and connections to the US procurement authorities than the Philippine businesses did for themselves . Mr. Bundy said that this was a problem that should be remedied as the new Procurement Information Office took hold , and that we would take all necessary steps that this was the case . President Marcos asked specifically about offshore procurement of drugs . Mr. Bundy explained that the US had engaged in such procurement only in very special cases where there was a marked quality and price advantage , as in one Italian situation . Mr. Bundy said that this had to be our policy , since our general attitude was one of limiting offshore procurement in every possible way for balance of payments reasons . If Philippine suppliers could qualify on the basis of such special advantages , they could participate , but only if this were the case . Mr. Bundy also referred to current US policy , under which steel products were not being purchased under offshore procurement , and explained that this was due in part to strong Congressional pressures . President Marcos finally agreed to the basic American language , but suggested the deletion of the last two sentences referring to the Procurement Information Office . This was accepted by President Johnson . 3 . Military construction . President Marcos asked acceptance of the Philippine language . President Johnson explained that this would carry the implication of an enlarged US undertaking , and that we simply could not do this , particularly at a time when we were cutting back military construction within the US . President Johnson said that we would simply have to leave it that we would go forward with any plans that were fully justified , but could make no undertaking in the communiqu\u00e9 . President Marcos accepted President Johnson 's position . 4 . Over-all settlement of veterans matters . President Johnson referred to the proposed Philippine sentence that would have called for an over-all , Congressionally-approved settlement of all veterans matters . President Johnson explained that any further Congressional action in this area was out of the question . President Marcos accepted President Johnson 's position , and the language was removed . 5 . Special Fund for Education . President Marcos asked that the Philippine language be accepted , releasing the Fund to the Philippines and handing over its administration to a joint commission , with specified categories of use . President Johnson said that he was prepared to release the funds as rapidly as projects were approved , and specifically indicated that if President Marcos wished to go ahead with the allocation of $ 3 million for the cultural center he would be prepared to approve this and to start the machinery . ( President Marcos did not himself refer to the cultural center , or pick up this specific offer . ) However , President Johnson said that the existing joint panels had been established to develop project proposals , and that the thing to do was to have them get on with it . Finally , President Johnson said that we could not release the Fund to the Philippines for balance of payments reasons . After some brief discussion , President Marcos accepted the deletion of the Philippine language , and it was agreed that the American language would be revised to constitute a direction to the joint panels to accelerate their work , with the two Presidents concurring that there should be rapid payout as projects were approved . 6 . Paragraph order . President Johnson began by saying that he might have made a mistake in suggesting that the science paragraphs come first , and that of course he would be prepared to accept another order if President Marcos desired . Nonetheless , he wanted to make clear that his reason for putting the science paragraphs first was to get the `` dollar sign `` out of the communiqu\u00e9 , and to make clear that the two Presidents had talked of broader and more fundamental things . He enlarged on this point at some length , referring to the problem of a large country appearing to give largesse to a smaller country . Basically , President Johnson stressed his belief that the proposed paragraph order was in the interests of President Marcos himself . President Marcos seemed to take to this argument , and there was some lighter exchange . Finally , President Marcos turned to his delegation and asked who had suggested the transposition , implying that it had never been his idea in the first place . Secretary Romualdez said that he had suggested the changes . President Marcos finally said that of course he would accept President Johnson 's paragraph order and thought it was fine . This ended the substantive discussions on a light and friendly note . 345 . Editorial Note President Johnson and Secretary Rusk talked on the telephone on September 16 , 1966 , at 10:18 a.m . The first 2 minutes and 8 seconds of the conversation were not available because of donor deed restrictions , so it begins with Rusk responding to the President , who was clearly annoyed and displeased , apparently at press reports of his discussion with Marcos : Rusk : I will try to turn this around a bit at my press conference this afternoon . Johnson : I just sure would . I would take every item and show it 's a regular and moderate item that has been presented . And the President [ Marcos ] did not come and did not spend any of his hour and ten minutes discussing loans or aid . He said that he did n't want to discuss that and President Johnson agreed .", "prompt_token_num": 2806, "completion_token_num": 60, "total_token_num": 2866}, {"document_title": "Leadership Team / Minnesota.gov", "url": "https://mn.gov/commerce/about/leadership/", "snippet": "Commissioner, Commerce Department.

The 25 banks deregulated include the U.S. holding companies of massive , scandal-plagued foreign banks\u2014such as Deutsche Bank , BNP Paribas , UBS , and Credit Suisse\u2014the last banks on earth that should be deregulated.11 The bill also lowers the loss-absorbing capital cushions at two of the eight most systemically important banks in the United States , State Street Corp. and The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. , which play a systemic role in the plumbing of the financial sector\u2014holding a combined $ 60 trillion in assets under custody and administration.12 Lower capital cushions make these banks less resilient and more vulnerable to a financial shock . The bill exempts from the Volcker Rule all banks with less than $ 10 billion in assets that also have limited trading assets . That means these banks can engage in risky , speculative activities with taxpayer-insured deposits . Although most of these banks do not trade for their own profit , the bill would allow them to invest in hedge funds and private equity funds\u2014putting local economies that depend on these banks at risk.13 Read more on Dodd-Frank and bank regulation An Action Plan for the Bank Regulators ReportJun 9 , 2022 An Action Plan for the Bank Regulators Jun 9 , 2022 Todd Phillips , Jeremy Kress Housing provisions Despite the central role of the housing market leading up to the financial crisis14 and the Great Recession , a number of the bill \u2019 s so-called community bank relief measures would reintroduce risk to the housing market at a time when the national homeownership rate is at decades-long lows.15 These provisions would only increase risk to consumers and taxpayers , rather than sustainably expanding ownership . By permitting steering by manufactured-home companies to their affiliated lenders\u2014in other words , directing borrowers toward the company \u2019 s preferred lender\u2014the bill makes a laughingstock of Congress \u2019 commitment to rural Americans , especially those of modest means . As a particular carveout for the manufactured-home industry regardless of the size of the lender , it increases the costs and risk to borrowers who are already often lower-income and more financially vulnerable.16 Minimal consumer protections included in the bill are less than what exists today , which means they are not strong enough . The bill also eliminates escrow requirements for higher-cost mortgages made by banks and credit unions with assets of up to $ 10 billion , up from $ 2 billion currently.17 Escrow is an essential borrower protection , an arrangement that prominently identifies the full cost of a mortgage loan for a prospective homebuyer and prevents the likelihood of losing a home due to an unpaid tax lien or subjection to expensive force-placed insurance , in which the lender , not the borrower , picks the insurance on the home.18 Rather than being packaged and sold to investors in the secondary market , some of the riskiest mortgage loans made prior to the financial crisis were held in portfolio\u2014in other words , kept on the lender \u2019 s books.19 Yet for banks and credit unions that have from $ 2 billion to $ 10 billion in assets , the bill would newly exempt loans held in portfolio from requirements under the Qualified Mortgage rule,20 in which lenders ordinarily must assess the borrower \u2019 s ability to repay . This dramatically expands what was a carveout for the smallest lenders , as well as gives lenders a major safe harbor for nontraditional underwriting practices reminiscent of those that caused the crisis . For more than 40 years , the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( HMDA ) has been at the center of fair lending research and enforcement.21 Dodd-Frank requires mortgage lenders to collect new data points about borrowers , including age , credit score , and detailed racial and ethnic breakdowns , in order to better monitor discriminatory or predatory practices.22 Yet S. 2155 would exempt approximately 85 percent of lenders from these reporting requirements , taking away an essential tool to ensure that homebuyers are not unfairly denied or overcharged.23 The bill also rolls back appraisal requirements for higher-risk mortgages in rural areas , further risking dangerous mortgage practices . This and many other provisions ignore the causes of the crisis and are solutions in search of a problem . Instead of narrowly tailoring rules to address specific concerns in the marketplace , the bill creates massive new risks in the housing market . Consumer protection provisions As a whole , the bill violates a core tenet of the Dodd-Frank Act and its consumer-facing regulations\u2014regulating financial products not based merely on who offers them but on what the products do . For a homebuyer , the size of the originating bank should not determine whether he or she obtains a fair deal and a safe mortgage . There are some modest consumer provisions in the bill , including the right to free credit freezes and protections for veterans \u2019 medical debt . On balance , however , these are mere crumbs relative to the rewards given to large and small banks under this bill . The bill does nothing to address the Wells Fargo and Equifax scandals24 that brought needless costs and risk to the American people , nor does it address the nation \u2019 s nearly $ 1.5 trillion25 in student debt . These so-called protections are largely inconsequential in light of the major deregulation efforts underway by Trump appointees at federal financial regulators . For instance , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has weakened bank assessments under the Community Reinvestment Act26 and blessed a form of payday lending by banks,27 while the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) has delayed a long-awaited rule on high-cost payday loans.28 The CFPB recently dropped its investigation into the Equifax scandal29 and also dropped an investigation into a payday lender charging 950 percent interest that donated to Acting CFPB Director Mick Mulvaney \u2019 s 2014 and 2016 congressional campaigns.30 If Congress truly wanted to support consumer protections , it would expand its oversight of these and other regulators and direct them to take action on key consumer concerns.31 It would also expand private rights of action and end the practice of forced arbitration , so that victims could seek justice in the courts should financial regulators fail to protect them.32 Instead , President Donald Trump and Congress overturned the CFPB \u2019 s arbitration rule , which would have restored consumers \u2019 right to band together to take financial companies to court.33 Rebutting key claims made by S. 2155 supporters Supporters of S. 2155 have advanced several arguments as to why progressive critiques of the bill are off base . These arguments , however , fall short . Here is a closer look at why some arguments in support of the bill miss the mark . Claim : The bill only increases Dodd-Frank \u2019 s $ 50 billion threshold to $ 100 billion Bill supporters claim that because the Federal Reserve retains the authority to reapply Dodd-Frank \u2019 s enhanced prudential standards to banks with from $ 100 billion to $ 250 billion in assets , the legislation essentially only increases the threshold from $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion . It is highly irresponsible to trust that Trump-appointed financial regulators keen on financial deregulation will aggressively use the Federal Reserve \u2019 s authority to reapply these enhanced regulatory standards to banks with from $ 100 billion to $ 250 billion in assets . If anything , Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles has signaled that he wants to go even further in easing regulations for the biggest banks.34 Claim : Banks with from $ 50 billion to $ 250 billion in assets should not be regulated like the largest banks The current regulatory regime already sensibly tailors the enhanced regulations based on the size and risk profiles of different banks . The $ 50 billion threshold is simply a clear and straightforward way to identify the 40 largest banks in the United States that merit heightened scrutiny . It is not a one-size-fits-all threshold . Banks with from $ 50 billion to $ 250 billion in assets are not subject to at least nine enhanced regulations to which the largest banks must adhere . A $ 50 billion bank faces far less stringent regulations than the most systemically important banks in the United States that have trillions of dollars in assets . Banks with between $ 50 billion and $ 250 billion in assets should , however , face a minimum level of heighted regulations that includes enhanced capital and liquidity requirements , stress testing", "prompt_token_num": 2213, "completion_token_num": 69, "total_token_num": 2282}]}

And it \u2019 s [ the Taliban \u2019 s ] most effective ambush tactic , so they really want to kill you . \u201d Kevin Nicholson \u2019 s home office is filled with memorabilia from his time in the armed forces . | Darren Hauck for Politico Magazine Nicholson , a Marine captain by the time of his second deployment , was awarded the Bronze Star for leading the specialized counter-IED team in Afghanistan . He returned home in 2009 and left the military that summer , having been accepted into the dual MBA/MPA program put on by Dartmouth and Harvard . Nicholson was offered a full-time job by McKinsey after interning with the consulting behemoth in the summer of 2010 , but deferred the position until he had finished the graduate program . When he did , in the summer of 2012 , Nicholson and his young family moved back home to metropolitan Milwaukee . By this point , word of Nicholson \u2019 s political conversion had spread\u2014thanks in part to Jessie sharing on Facebook her husband \u2019 s writings on pension reform\u2014and many of their friends , regardless of political affiliation , assumed Nicholson was putting down roots to run for public office . They were right . Over the next several years , the Nicholsons worked systematically to cultivate relationships with activists , donors , elected officials and other political players in the state . That work paid off : Nicholson caught the attention of Jeff Harris , a major GOP donor , and Brett Healy , an influential conservative with deep relationships in Madison . Harris and Healy , according to numerous Wisconsin Republicans I spoke with , became Nicholson \u2019 s unofficial gatekeepers : making key introductions , promoting Nicholson to their allies as a once-in-a-generation political prospect , and grooming him for an eventual campaign . \u201c His conservative bona fides were reinforced by the people who vouched for him , \u201d says Matt Batzel , the Wisconsin-based executive director of the grass-roots-organizing group American Majority . \u201c And when you meet him and talk to him , you have no doubt that he \u2019 s a conservative . \u201d Nearly every Republican I spoke with says their introduction with Nicholson was brokered by either Harris or Healy , neither of whom would comment for this story . This is almost certainly how Nicholson got an audience with Dick and Liz Uihlein , the megadonor couple that gave more than $ 23 million to conservative candidates and causes in the 2016 cycle . ( Nicholson tells me only that a \u201c mutual friend \u201d set up the meeting . ) It \u2019 s known in GOP circles that Dick and Liz don \u2019 t always agree on politicians to support ; it raised eyebrows , then , after the initial $ 3.5 million was pledged to Nicholson \u2019 s super PAC , when both joined the candidate \u2019 s finance committee . Uihlein is one of the Club for Growth \u2019 s biggest donors\u2014which didn \u2019 t hurt Nicholson \u2019 s dogged pursuit of the group \u2019 s endorsement\u2014and is poised to rally other Republican rainmakers to Nicholson \u2019 s cause . If financial might is fueling much of the hype surrounding Nicholson , there are reasons to suspect he won \u2019 t live up to it . His name identification in Wisconsin is all but nonexistent . Vukmir has her own deep-pocketed supporters , starting with Diane Hendricks , the richest Republican donor in the state . Eric Hovde , a self-funding businessman who finished a close second in the 2012 primary , is weighing another run . The pivotal endorsements in Wisconsin come not from national groups such as the Club for Growth ( whose endorsed candidate in 2012 finished third in the GOP primary ) , but from conservative talk-radio in the southeast corner of the state , which is Vukmir \u2019 s territory . His biographical vulnerabilities aside , Nicholson is raw as a retail campaigner and can come across as programmed and mistake-averse . If he wins the nomination and squares off against Baldwin\u2014who is certainly beatable , having run behind Obama in 2012\u2014Nicholson will have to spend next fall tap-dancing around Trump ( about whom he \u2019 s been advised not to utter a negative word ) . He \u2019 ll also have to show a better command of the issues : Nicholson is playing to a perceived strength by attacking Baldwin \u2019 s poor handling of a Veterans Affairs scandal in Wisconsin , but when I ask him about the VA accountability bill that Trump signed into law this summer , Nicholson admits to not knowing the details . All of that said , and given his manifest upside as a candidate , I was stunned at the degree to which the most prominent Wisconsin Republicans I spoke with\u2014in particular , close allies of Speaker Paul Ryan , Governor Scott Walker and former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus\u2014were dismissive of Nicholson \u2019 s chances . Some of this skepticism , in both Madison and Washington , speaks to the pack mentality of veteran politicians trusting only one of their own . There \u2019 s also an element of jealousy : Out-of-nowhere phenoms like Nicholson aren \u2019 t often well received by members of the party who have spent years paying their dues . But above all , the rookie candidate must overcome a fundamental deficit of trust : In countless conversations , people who have met with Nicholson tell me they aren \u2019 t convinced he is truly a conservative . \u201c I \u2019 m not buying it , \u201d Scott Fitzgerald , the state Senate majority leader , tells me . Fitzgerald , who has announced his support of Vukmir , says Nicholson reached out to him earlier this year after Rep. Sean Duffy , a presumed challenger to Baldwin , opted not to run . They had a cup of coffee , and Fitzgerald saw the upside others are investing in . But it wasn \u2019 t enough . \u201c I \u2019 ve met those types of candidates\u2014sometimes they \u2019 re successful , but other times they turn out to be show horses instead of workhorses , \u201d Fitzgerald says . \u201c It \u2019 s a roll of the dice with Kevin , because you just don \u2019 t know enough about him . You don \u2019 t know who he really is . \u201d Share on Facebook Share on Twitter This article tagged under : Republicans Wisconsin The POLITICO Mag Profile POLITICO Magazine 2018 Show Comments More from POLITICO Magazine California California 's road to recovery runs through D.C.

There \u2019 s Just One Problem ... Two decades ago , Kevin Nicholson was a rising star in the Democratic Party . Then he disappeared . Now he \u2019 s running for U.S. Senate \u2014 as a conservative Republican . By TIM ALBERTA September 22 , 2017 Continue to article content Facebook Twitter Comment Print Continue to article content Tim Alberta is a national political reporter at Politico Magazine . GREENVILLE , Wis. \u2014 Kevin Nicholson has a confession to make , if only someone would listen . Standing on a makeshift stage inside a burgundy-colored barn rented by the Republican Party of Outagamie County\u2014two hours north of Milwaukee , just west of Green Bay\u2014the U.S. Senate candidate and unlikely new object of conservative fascination has broken into a biographical speech . But many attendees don \u2019 t seem to care . He isn \u2019 t unique in receiving this treatment ; the audience , buzzing off plates of barbecue and $ 2 cans of Miller Lite , was just as irreverent toward their own congressman , Mike Gallagher , as well as Leah Vukmir , a state senator and Nicholson \u2019 s rival in the Republican primary . With the barn \u2019 s metal gates flung upward to welcome August \u2019 s evening breath , and clusters of party loyalists chattering in buffet lines and around red-plastic-draped picnic tables , the acoustics are dreadful for a rookie politician hoping to be heard . But then it happens : Nicholson , a decorated combat veteran and business wunderkind with advanced degrees from Harvard and Dartmouth , begins taming the crowd , one expertly crafted anecdote at a time . He recalls his experience fighting and losing friends in Iraq , as Democrats \u201c lied \u201d about the gains his Marines made . He tells of adventures in academia , where he could \u201c test the assumptions of the elites and the experts to find out what they really don \u2019 t know . \u201d He mentions his time as a McKinsey consultant , engineering corporate restructurings around the world , as a segue to denouncing the \u201c garbage \u201d math in Washington on the sustainability of America \u2019 s debt . The longer he goes , the quieter his audience gets . Nicholson arrived here a virtual unknown ; the strapping , clean-shaven 39-year-old , with light blue eyes and a wavy dark mane , lingered awkwardly near tables to present himself . But as he concludes his remarks , attendees begin approaching the podium . The first one there is Jack Voight , a former state treasurer who recently retired from local office and promised his wife he wouldn \u2019 t go near another campaign . Voight engages Nicholson in a passionate , minutelong dialogue , the two men gripping each others \u2019 hands in an arm-wrestling stance . Voight gives the candidate his phone number and tells him to call tomorrow . \u201c I know where all the bodies are buried , \u201d Voight tells him , grinning . Just like that , Nicholson has gained an influential ally . This is becoming routine . Since declaring his candidacy in late July , Nicholson has won the endorsement of the Club for Growth , the influential and well-heeled conservative group ; secured the backing of former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton and his affiliated PAC ; and assembled an impressive roster of wealthy Republicans to helm his campaign \u2019 s financial operation . Most important is the support Nicholson won before entering the race : Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein , titans in the conservative donor universe , parked $ 3.5 million in a super PAC for him , baffling rivals in both parties and lending the little-known , first-time candidate instant viability . It \u2019 s rare\u2014practically unheard of\u2014for an established donor to spend that kind of money on an unproven commodity . Then again , candidates like Kevin Nicholson don \u2019 t come around every day . It should come as no shock that some Republicans have fallen for him : With his Hollywood looks , military pedigree , Ivy League smarts and private-sector proficiency , Nicholson could have been built in a GOP laboratory . He is hungry and confident and committed , having oriented much of his adult life around an eventual run for public office . His published writings on pension reform read like a product of the Heritage Foundation ; his voluntary second tour overseas is the stuff ad-makers fantasize about . He is , for comparison \u2019 s sake , a wealthier , better-looking and more charming version of Senator Tom Cotton . \u201c Kevin is even more impressive in person than he is on paper , \u201d gushes David McIntosh , the former congressman and Club for Growth president . Kevin Nicholson in his home office in Pewaukee , Wisconsin . | Darren Hauck for Politico Magazine The spell Nicholson has cast over a number of influential Republicans is a source of wonder in Wisconsin these days . Yet people who know him say the explanation isn \u2019 t terribly complicated . \u201c He \u2019 s a McKinsey consultant . His job is to walk in a room of powerful , wealthy people , blow them away , and get their money , \u201d says one state official who is friendly with Nicholson but obligated to remain neutral in the race . \u201c And he \u2019 s very , very good at it . \u201d Another person who spoke on condition of anonymity\u2014a longtime friend of Nicholson \u2019 s who is a Democrat , and therefore loath to either hurt or help him with an on-record statement\u2014says none of Nicholson \u2019 s early success is surprising . \u201c I \u2019 m guessing once he managed somehow to get in front of Dick Uihlein , he just impressed the shit out of him . I \u2019 m sure he laid out the case and convinced them he could make it happen , \u201d the friend says . \u201c I \u2019 ve seen it\u2014the guy \u2019 s fucking incredible . Nobody knows him , and he \u2019 s arguably the front-runner for the nomination for U.S. Senate . \u201d But there \u2019 s a glaring flaw in his otherwise immaculate r\u00e9sum\u00e9 : Kevin Nicholson hasn \u2019 t always been a Republican . He was once an aspiring politician and rising star\u2014in the Democratic Party . * * * In 1999 , Nicholson , a junior at the University of Minnesota , won an upset victory to become president of the College Democrats of America . The trappings included a full-time position at the Democratic National Committee in Washington and a speaking slot at the party \u2019 s 2000 convention . The archived C-SPAN clip of Nicholson \u2019 s nearly three-minute speech\u2014in which he declares , \u201c We care about a woman \u2019 s right to choose \u201d \u2014is emblematic of the minefield he must navigate en route to the Republican nomination , much less a general election victory . His high-profile stint as a Democrat , followed by what is better described as an evolution rather than a road-to-Damascus conversion , offers lip-licking openings for opponents to question his credibility , consistency and character . What has turned up so far\u2014a laudatory letter he penned in 2000 to the pro-abortion group EMILY \u2019 s List ; questions about his voting record in the 2008 primary ; personal attacks from his former college roommate\u2014are the political equivalent of body blows . Democrats , fearful of losing Tammy Baldwin \u2019 s seat in a state President Donald Trump carried last fall , are actively searching for a knockout , having built an atypically large opposition-research effort in hopes of derailing Nicholson before his campaign picks up steam . He understands the scope of the dirt-digging\u2014with former friends , colleagues and even roommates teaming up to take him down\u2014and therefore seizes every occasion to talk about his past . The goal is to inoculate his candidacy in the hopes that voters will view attacks on his college activism as old news . But his strategy is not merely a defensive one . Nicholson knows that Wisconsin \u2019 s Republican base is comprised of many white , working-class voters who were Democrats themselves not a generation ago ; the objective in playing up his Democratic roots is to turn a potentially crippling liability into his campaign \u2019 s unlikeliest asset . \u201c It \u2019 s something I \u2019 ve embraced , \u201d he tells me , riding north on I-43 toward Greenville in the back row of his family \u2019 s black", "prompt_token_num": 2096, "completion_token_num": 118, "total_token_num": 2214}, {"document_title": "'Between the World and Me' by Ta-Nehisi Coates - The Atlantic", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/tanehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me/397619/", "snippet": "Jul 4, 2015 ...

In beating George H.W . Bush ( albeit with Ross Perot 's help ) , Clinton had tossed aside the old guard and ushered in a new era of youthful enthusiasm . After all , Clinton was the president who , following his election , was asked on television whether he wore boxers or briefs and answered as flippantly as if he had been asked about Egypt 's gross domestic product.During the election , young people ate it up . Most important , Clinton 's regular-guy style appealed to one voter who was voting for the first time in 1992 : Me.At one time , I was the perfect representative of the old maxim ( misattributed to pretty much every famous orator of the past couple of centuries ) that he who is not a liberal when he is 20 has no heart and whoever is not a conservative when he is 30 has no brain . ( I finally came around when I realized FICA was n't the name of a new Pearl Jam album . ) Even today , ideological transformations are happening before our eyes . Take the 2018 Wisconsin Senate race , where Republicans have a strong chance of picking up the seat currently held by Democrat Tammy Baldwin . In 2012 , Baldwin was elected while clinging to Barack Obama 's coattails ; in 2018 , she will have no such boost.This is why a gaggle of Republicans already are positioning themselves for a run at Baldwin . And two of the primary competitors are new not only to politics , but to the Republican Party itself.BICE : Baldwin says Sheriff David Clarke is being 'groomed ' for Senate bidBack in 2000 , Kevin Nicholson served as head of the College Democrats of America , which is a fairly non-traditional start to a career in Republican politics . Nicholson , who has since become a U.S. Marine veteran and businessman , actually addressed the 2000 Democratic National Convention , promoting both legal abortion and the nomination of Vice President Al Gore . Now that he 's floating his name as a possible GOP senator , Nicholson claims he no longer holds these views , and frequently mentions his life as a Democrat in his speeches.Ironically , a group with financial ties to Nicholson 's supporters recently attacked Green Bay educator and potential candidate Nicole Schneider for being insufficiently conservative . Schneider ( no relation to me , but given that she 's part of the Schneider trucking empire , I 'd be happy to take a DNA test ) , has gotten heat for her pesky habit of taking to social media to either praise Democratic politicians or criticize Republicans . While her skepticism over Donald Trump 's candidacy certainly is n't a deal-breaker , she should be ready to explain her apparent enthusiasm for Obamacare.If the 2016 presidential election taught us anything , it 's that voters are willing to accept candidates who have had a partisan change of heart . Trump was an abortion-loving , Hillary Clinton-donating , single-payer health care enthusiast just years before he ran for president as a Republican . Ronald Reagan famously spent most of his adult life as a Democrat . Even Hillary Clinton claims she was once a `` Goldwater girl `` as a youngster , completely inverting the aforementioned `` heart vs. brain `` formulation.But , Trump aside , those examples may not be all that instructive , as they happened before the era of social media . Today , flip-flops can be plastered all over Twitter and Facebook \u2014 previous statements never go away.RELATED : What did Donald Trump tweet in his first 100 days ? And that is particularly problematic when the race features strong conservatives who do n't carry baggage from previous Democratic flirtations . If state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Wauwatosa or state Rep. Dale Kooyenga of Brookfield enter the race , voters can choose candidates who wo n't have to waste time explaining their conservative credentials to primary voters . Each of those state legislators can boast a list of conservative accomplishments as long as their arm.While it is true Trump won Wisconsin in November , it also is important to note that he badly lost the Republican primary the previous April . In primaries , Wisconsin Republicans have a very acute manure-tolerance meter . And while it 's too early to rule out either Schneider or Nicholson , they better be ready to spend a lot of money convincing GOP voters that they now possess Republican brains.Christian Schneider is a Journal Sentinel columnist and blogger .

If someone is having a loud party in your neighborhood you may call the Police Department for assistance . When deciding whether to call the police you must also decide whether the noise is at a level that your peace is being disturbed . If it is , you next need to decide whether you would be willing to press formal charges in order to get the noise to stop or be turned down to a tolerable level . Most often , the mere fact that you are willing to press charges will help us to solve the problem so that no actual charges need be pressed . If you decide to call the police , use the non-emergency number , ( 831 ) 758-7321 , and not 911 . When you call the police you will be asked several things . In addition to getting your name , address and telephone number the person you talk to will also ask you if you are willing to press charges or if you are willing to speak with an officer directly . We recommend that you provide the dispatcher with your name , address and telephone number even if you do not want to press charges or be contacted . This will help us if other calls are received about the same party . Do not call the anonymous tip line or use the \u201c contact us \u201d page to make a complaint . What if I do not want to give my name and address ? If you do not want to give your name and address you may still call the police and report the noise . The officer who is assigned to the nearby area will be told that a person has called about the noise . Depending on other calls for service , the officer may make an attempt to drive by the party and , if necessary , warn the party giver that a complaint was received . It may be difficult for the officers to quiet the party since the officer has no way of ordering the party giver to turn down the music or face arrest or a citation . The officer may try to quiet the party by enforcing other laws at or near the party such as , drinking in public , curfew , etc . If the party continues , or you decide that you are willing to press charges in order to quiet the party , you may call back and tell the dispatcher that you are willing to do so . What laws are being broken if I give a loud party and refuse to lower or stop the noise ? There are several laws that may be broken if you are responsible for giving a party that is too loud . The California Penal Code ( 415.2 ) states that it is illegal to maliciously and willfully disturb another person by loud and unreasonable noise . The Salinas Municipal Code states that it is illegal to use any sound equipment between the hours of 10:00 p.m .. and 7:00 a.m. , or at any time when it is unreasonably loud . It is also a violation of the Salinas City Code ( 5-11.03 ) to willfully make any loud , unnecessary , or unusual noise which disturbs the peace or quiet of any neighborhood . You could be issued a citation or be subject to arrest for a violation of either of these codes .

If you are in custody of the San Diego County Jail , you may use a special lawyer telephone line to call the Office of the Public Defender free of charge ; a receptionist will connect you to your attorney 's telephone . Go to Top of Page MISDEMEANOR CHARGES Question : What is a misdemeanor ? Answer : A misdemeanor is a criminal charge that can carry a maximum sentence of 365 days in county jail and/or a substantial monetary fine . ARRAIGNMENT : Your first court appearance is called an ARRAIGNMENT . There are five main purposes of ARRAIGNMENT : 1 . The first purpose of ARRAIGNMENT is to formally advise you of the misdemeanor charge ( s ) brought against you by the prosecutor . For all misdemeanor cases , the prosecutor is called a city attorney . The charge ( s ) against you are contained in a document called the complaint . The complaint contains language from the actual law you are accused of violating with very little information specific to your case , other then the date the offense allegedly occurred . 2 . The second purpose of ARRAIGNMENT is to appoint an attorney to represent you if you can not afford to hire one . If you are in jail the day of your arraignment the court will appoint an attorney to represent you . If you are not in jail the day of your arraignment , the court will ask you to fill out a financial declaration to determine whether your financial situation requires the court to appoint an attorney for you or whether you can afford to hire an attorney . If the court finds that you are financially ineligible for a court appointed attorney your arraignment will be continued for a short period of time so you can hire an attorney to represent you . You will speak with an attorney from the Public Defender 's Office before you actually go in front of the judge for your ARRAIGNMENT . This attorney will have a copy of the complaint against you and/or the police report or citation made at the time of the incident.The attorney will ask you to tell them your side of the story . It is important to tell the attorney everything about your case . Your conversation with that attorney is completely confidential and they will not divulge any part of your conversation to the city attorney . 3 . The third purpose of ARRAIGNMENT is to enter a plea to the charges against you . You have the choice of pleading Not Guilty , Guilty , or No Contest . The public defender that speaks to you about your case will also tell you if the city attorney has made any offers to settle your case for a less serious charge and/or a less serious sentence . A plea of Not Guilty means that you are not willing to take the prosecutor 's offer . It also means that the judge will set future court dates . At this time the public defender will formally request that the Public Defender 's Office be appointed as your attorney and will formally request a jury trial . Although a date will not be set for your trial at this time , if you are in jail , your trial date is set within 30 days of your ARRAIGNMENT or within 45 days if you are not in jail . A plea of Guilty means that you are willing to take advantage of the prosecutor 's offer . When you plead Guilty you will be immediately sentenced by the judge ( with very few exceptions ) . A plea of 'No Contest ' is almost identical to a Guilty plea . The only difference is that a 'No Contest ' plea can not be used as evidence of civil liability in a civil case arising from the same incident . The only time 'No Contest ' pleas are entered is for cases in which property damage or personal injuries have occurred . Often the prosecutor will not allow a 'No Contest ' plea to an offer they have extended . For some charges you will be required to initial and sign a change of plea form . Your public defender will explain this form to you . This form basically contains the terms of your agreement with the prosecutor and some other terms the court wants you to know . 4 . The fourth purpose of ARRAIGNMENT is for the court to set future court dates for you to appear on your case . As stated above , even when you plead Not Guilty to a charge , you must come back for at least one more court date ( usually more ) . Even if you plead Guilty or 'No Contest ' to a charge you will most likely have a date set in the future to show proof of compliance with specific requirements of your sentence or probation . Following your ARRAIGNMENT the court will provide you with a pink piece of paper containing your future court dates and information about what occurred during your court appearance . Never leave court without this piece of paper . 5 . The fifth purpose of ARRAIGNMENT is to address the issue of bail . If you are in jail at the time of ARRAIGNMENT , the public defender will argue to have your bail reduced or ask to release you without bail ( on your own recognizance . or OR ) . Remember , the judge is required to assume the charges against you are true for the purposes of setting bail . The judge will consider factors such as the seriousness of the charges and whether you will return for your next court appearance . If you have a parole hold or INS hold ( immigration ) the judge will not release you and you will not be able to `` bail out `` unless these holds are lifted . If you are not in jail at the time of your arraignment , it is unlikely the judge will set bail in your case . In almost all cases the judge will allow you to remain out of jail for the duration of your case . FIRST MEETING/CONVERSATION WITH YOUR ATTORNEY : The terms lawyer , attorney , and public defender can be used interchangeably . A public defender is a lawyer ( attorney ) that represents people that can not afford to hire one . If you have entered a plea of Not Guilty at your ARRAIGNMENT , your case is immediately sent to the Public Defender 's Office where it is assigned to one of the attorneys in the office . You should receive a call from your attorney within one week from your arraignment . If you do not speak to your attorney by this time , you should call the office at ( 619 ) 338-4700 and ask to be transferred to the attorney assigned to your case . Have your case number available . If you schedule an appointment to meet with your attorney , be sure to bring all documents , photographs , names , addresses and telephone numbers of witnesses and anything else that is relevant to your case . Since the time between arraignment and trial is only 45 days ( if you are out of jail at the time of arraignment ) , it is very important to help your attorney prepare in the most time efficient way possible . However , NEVER attempt to speak to the alleged victim in the case ( if there is one ) . Your attorney will make arrangements for an investigator to interview possible witnesses including the alleged victim . It is very important to stay in touch with this attorney and advise them of any address or phone number changes that occur during your case.If you forget your public defender 's name , you should call the public defender general number : ( 619 ) 338-4700 . Remember that all public defenders have very busy court schedules and are usually in court between 8:15am and 4:30pm Monday through Friday . If you do not immediately receive a return call from your attorney , they will almost certainly return your call within a day . TRIAL SETTING DEPARTMENT ( TSD ) : If you did not plead Guilty or No Contest at your ARRAIGNMENT , your second court appearance will most likely be your readiness conference held in the TRIAL SETTING DEPARTMENT ( TSD ) . This is another opportunity to negotiate your case with the prosecutor . At this time they may make an offer to settle for a less serious charge or sentence . Many times this offer is not any better than", "prompt_token_num": 1917, "completion_token_num": 72, "total_token_num": 1989}]}

( Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images ) Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has a new partner in her battle against Donald Trump : Sen. Elizabeth Warren , who gave a speech Tuesday mirroring Clinton 's own talking points accusing Trump of profiting from the housing crash of 2008 . Warren , D-Massachusetts , has stayed , `` Warren said . `` What kind of a man does that ? Root for people to get thrown out on the street ? Root for people to lose their jobs ? Root for people to lose their pensions ? `` The timing of her remarks Tuesday , and their convergence with Clinton 's stump message in California the same day , was not entirely a coincidence . And it may serve a dual purpose for Clinton : helping her begin the general-election battle against Trump , but also beginning the difficult task of unifying the fractured Democratic Party . Warren enjoys strong support with many of the Democratic constituencies passionate about Sanders . An aide said she takes seriously her potential role in helping to bring those constituencies together and focus the party 's energy on defeating Trump . Among other points , she criticized Trump for proposing a plan that would dismantle Dodd-Frank financial regulations . `` Donald Trump is worried about helping poor little Wall Street ? `` Warren asked . `` Let me find the world 's smallest violin to play a sad , sad song . `` `` Can Donald Trump even name three things that Dodd-Frank does ? Seriously , someone ask him , `` she added . While campaigning in California , Clinton used Trump 's own words to make a similar case : that he cheered on the market crash eight years ago . `` Trump economics is a recipe for lower wages , fewer jobs and more debt , `` Clinton told a crowd here Tuesday afternoon . `` You know what happened in the Great Recession . Donald Trump said when he was talking about the possibility of a housing-market crash before the Great Recession , he said , ' I sort of hope that happens , ' `` Clinton said . `` He actually said he was hoping for the crash that caused hard-working families in California and across the country to lose their homes . `` Clinton and more than a dozen surrogates and allies hammered the message across the country Tuesday , showing a level of coordination on message and strategy that amounts to a dry run for the general election . Trump wasted no time to respond to the attacks . `` I am a businessman , and I have made a lot of money in down markets , `` he said in a statement distributed to reporters . `` In some cases , as much as I 've made when markets are good . Frankly , this is the kind of thinking our country needs , understanding how to get a good result out of a very bad and sad situation . `` Speaking at a rally in in Albuquerque , New Mexico , on Tuesday night , he called Clinton a `` low life `` for using a clip of his comments about the housing crisis in an ad . `` I 'm a businessman , that 's what I 'm supposed to do , `` he said . He also targeted Warren , calling her `` Pocahontas `` and accusing her of saying that she was Native American because `` her cheekbones were high . `` `` She is probably the senator that 's doing just about the least in the United States Senate , `` he said of Warren . `` She 's a total failure . `` Outside the venue of the rally , protesters threw burning T-shirts , plastic bottles and other items at officers , and police responded by firing pepper spray and smoke grenades into the crowd outside the venue . Elected leaders , including Colorado Gov . John Hickenlooper , Rep. Ed Perlmutter , D-Colorado , Sen. Timothy M. Kaine , D-Virginia , and Rep. Tim Ryan , D-Ohio , held calls with local and national reporters to push the message . `` This is Trump 's view of the world : When Americans suffer , Trump looks to cash in , `` Ryan said on a conference call with reporters . Pro-Clinton group Americans United for Change , the AFL-CIO and other progressive groups rallied outside of Trump 's soon-to-be hotel in Washington , District of Columbia , toting anti-Trump signs that repeated - word for word - the message that Ryan delivered on the call . Clinton has for weeks been bogged down in a two-front war against Trump and Sanders . But since Trump essentially secured his party 's nomination in April , Democrats have grown increasingly anxious that they are running out of precious time to set the terms of the general election before Trump does . `` We ca n't normalize Donald Trump - nothing about him is normal , `` Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Tuesday . Democrats have tried out different strategies to take on the presumptive GOP nominee , but Tuesday , Clinton sent a clear signal to her allies that they should focus on a single message : that Trump pursues profit above all else . The effort was also aimed specifically at voters in battleground states of Ohio , Virginia , Pennsylvania , Florida , New Hampshire , Iowa , Colorado and Nevada . The Washington Post reported earlier this year that in 2005 , Trump ignored growing warnings that the housing market was on shaky ground just before launching his failed mortgage company . Clinton and her surrogates also called attention to Trump 's statements in 2006 and 2007 - in the lead-up to the housing crash in 2008 - saying that if the housing bubble burst , he `` would go in and buy like crazy `` to make money . `` Now he says he wants to roll back the financial regulations that we have imposed on Wall Street to let them run wild again , `` Clinton said . She noted that Trump has `` experience with bankruptcy `` and questioned how he lost money in the casino business . `` He 's bankrupted companies , `` Clinton said . `` I do n't know if that 's one of the qualifications of running for president , but I kind of doubt it . `` Tumulty reported from Washington .

( Photo by Matthew Busch/Getty Images ) Matthew Busch / Getty ImagesPrintMay 23 , 2016 , 4:49 PM UTC / Updated May 23 , 2016 , 4:59 PM UTCBy Alexandra JaffeDonald Trump counseled Trump University students to take advantage of the housing bubble as an investment opportunity and said , just a year before it burst , that he was \u201c excited \u201d for it to end because of the money he \u2019 d make . \u201c People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years , and I 'm excited if it is , \u2019 he told the Globe and Mail in March of 2007 . \u201c I \u2019 ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets . \u201d At that time , the housing market was already beginning to decline , and just over a year later the subprime mortgage crisis hit , part of a chain reaction of events that led to the stock market crash of 2008 and cemented the Great Recession.The subprime mortgage crisis alone caused millions of Americans to lose their homes , but that same Globe and Mail piece reports Trump was \u201c advising investors that their are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount , and repossessed houses at low prices . \u201d It \u2019 s not a new \u2014 or particularly surprising \u2014 stance from the business mogul , who made a fortune he values in the billions investing over the course of four decades in real-estate in New York City and across the world . Trump has always touted himself as a great deal-maker and outlines the genesis of his penchant for risky investments in his first book , \u201c The Art of the Deal , \u201d which chronicles the early deals that helped establish him as a major player in New York \u2019 s real-estate market.But those comments are just one of many that could come back to haunt him as he heads into a general election showdown with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . Clinton and Democratic Party operatives have telegraphed plans to paint Trump as a greedy con-man whose business acumen is overblown and whose policies most benefit himself , and comments he \u2019 s made touting profits from the pain of millions of Americans who lost their homes in the housing market crash will help them make their case.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his past statements.His remarks to the Globe and Mail weren \u2019 t the only he made on the money-making possibilities found in a bursting bubble.The real-estate mogul lost big during the early 1990s recession , filing bankruptcies on a number of properties and liquidating others to keep himself above-water . But in 2004 , Trump told CNN , \u201c I love bad markets , \u201d insisting the real-estate market crash in the late 1980s wasn \u2019 t the main driver of his financial difficulties . \u201c The real estate markets crashed . Now , I do n't want to blame the real estate markets , because I always made a lot of money in bad markets . I love bad markets . You can do very well in a bad market , \u201d he said.And that was the exact advice he gave followers of Trump University a year later , framing the next housing bubble \u2014 at that time , still just a theoretical risk posed by analysts \u2014 as a \u201c remarkable opportunity . \u201d \u201c How you react to the so-called housing bubble can be a barometer of your business personality . Are you the type of person who takes advantage of positive situations when they present themselves\u2026or do you heed every message of doom and gloom , avoiding risks that could be some remarkable opportunities ? \u201d he wrote in a 2005 post on his Trump University blog.A CNN report last week unearthed his 2006 declaration in a Trump University audiobook that \u201c I sort of hope \u201d the real estate market crashes.In his 2006 audio book \u201c Bubble-Proof Real Estate Investing , \u201d Trump also framed the housing bubble as an opportunity for profit for those \u201c willing to do what it takes . `` \u201c Is it the so-called bubble you 're afraid of or is it hard work ?

NEWSCASTER : A no-fly zone is in effect . JOHN HOCKENBERRY , PRI 's The Takeaway : [ voice-over ] It was a big weekend in Chicago . Last spring , the president was in town , along with the leaders of NATO , to discuss threats to global security and nuclear proliferation . At a huge convention center , the eyes of the world were watching . But across town in a small hotel ballroom , the fate of the world was also on the agenda . The eyes of the world might have missed this gathering . SPEAKER : Get ready for your Al Gore snow job ! JOHN HOCKENBERRY : The message here is that man-made global climate change is a myth , a hoax . This conference is an annual pilgrimage for the key skeptics . We came here to understand how they have made their views a mainstream fact of American politics . They think of themselves as rebels up against the biggest players in science , government and the media . JOE BAST , President , Heartland Institute : \u2014wind and solar are based on public fear of global warming , and the mainstream media has pretty much given up its role as an independent reporter on these things and has become an advocate . MYRON EBELL , Competitive Enterprise Institute : If you add up all of the resources of our side of the debate and all of the resources of the other side of the debate , this is a David versus Goliath story . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ on camera ] You 're doing pretty well . MYRON EBELL : There are holdouts among the urban bicoastal elite , but I think we 've won the debate with the American people in the heartland , the people who get their hands dirty , people who dig up stuff , grow stuff and make stuff for a living , people who have a closer relationship to tangible reality , to stuff . We need to keep banging away on the science\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ voice-over ] Myron Ebell chairs a group called the Cooler Heads Coalition , one of a team of skilled policy advocates driving a remarkable turnaround that has already changed the U.S. political landscape . CHRISTOPHER MONCKTON , Science and Public Policy Institute : Warming is n't , in fact , accelerating . In fact , there 's been none for 15 years . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : There 's Christopher Monckton , a big draw at these meetings , who brings the skeptics to their feet every time . CHRISTOPHER MONCKTON : God bless America ! JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Republican congressman James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin , vice chairman of the House Science Committee . Rep. JAMES SENSENBRENNER ( R-WI ) , Vice Chair , Cmte . on Science , Space & Technology : Paul Krugman accused my colleagues and me of treason against the planet . [ laughter ] JOHN HOCKENBERRY : There 's Chris Horner from the Competitive Enterprise Institute , and James Taylor , senior fellow at the Heartland Institute , organizer of this gathering . JAMES TAYLOR , Heartland Institute : The debate indeed is over ! In the years prior to 2007 , the 2008 elections , we actually heard from many folks that we should tone it down on global warming , we should not talk about the issue , because the court of public opinion had already decided and we were on the losing end . But we believe that if we present the case to the American people and it resonates , if they get it , then that 's going to work its way up the political stepladder . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ on camera ] You 've really changed the game on global warming . JAMES TAYLOR : Oh , I certainly hope so . climate needs no help from worried humans . FRED SINGER , Founder , Science and Env . Policy Project : Climate , to me , has become a non-issue . It 's a phantom issue . There 's nothing wrong with climate . It will change no matter what we do . It 'll get colder . It 'll get warmer . We just have to wait a little . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Singer says he 's dedicated to explaining his theories about global warming . [ on camera ] What keeps you going ? What 's your motivation ? FRED SINGER : Basically , I like to see good science being done and protected . I think I 'm fighting here for scientific truth . That 's important to me . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Do you think the science is being hyped on global warming ? FRED SINGER : Oh , very definitely , yes . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ voice-over ] Armed with that conviction , this team of skilled political messengers and contrarians has certainly changed the game . In just four years , the number of Americans who agree global warming is manmade has dropped to about half . It 's a message that is inspiring a new generation of skeptics . CONFERENCE GOER : I would like to really listen to these scientists who came and talked and have dedicated their lives to debunking this fallacy , so to speak . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Once upon a time , what these people call a fallacy had another name , the truth . AL GORE , Fmr . Vice Pres . : [ `` Inconvenient Truth `` ] You 've heard of off the charts . Within less than 50 years , it 'll be here . The so-called skeptics\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : In 2006 , the film An Inconvenient Truth told a disturbing story and galvanized public awareness about the climate . BRIAN WILLIAMS , NBC News : And now to a new report on global warming from a prestigious panel of scientists convened by the U.N.\u2014 WOLF BLITZER , CNN : There 's a new grim report out today from\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : This comprehensive report in 2007 took it to another level . Scientists from 30 nations concluded that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is mostly the cause . SAM CHAMPION , ABC News Weather Editor : It is the definitive report on global warming , and it 's frightening . NOBEL CEREMONY : I call upon the Peace Prize laureate for 2007 , Al Gore , to come forward\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : The U.N. scientists and former vice president Al Gore would share the Nobel Peace Prize . The cause had a consensus and a credible leader . The skeptics would take on both . JAMES TAYLOR : I think Al Gore was probably the best thing that could happen to global warming skeptics . MYRON EBELL : From my perspective , Al Gore was the perfect proponent and leader of the global warming alarmists because he 's very politically divisive and controversial . TIM PHILLIPS , Pres . , Americans for Prosperity : I think it was his tone and manner . He did at a certain point come across as holier than thou . And that 's another thing about Americans . They 're not really big on holier than thou . SEAN HANNITY , Fox News Channel : Now , that is a G2-V aircraft\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Personalizing the attacks was part of an approach that was immediately embraced and amplified by friendly media . SEAN HANNITY : And that is the former vice president getting off that plane , into a Town Car , by the way , not a hybrid ! CHRIS HORNER , Competitive Enterprise Institute : He equates the failure to recycle aluminum cans with the Holocaust ! MYRON EBELL , Competitive Enterprise Institute : He wants to be a superhero action figure . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Myron Ebell was acting on a broad strategy he helped create more than a decade ago . In this 1998 action plan , `` Victory will be achieved , `` it said , when the public `` recognizes uncertainties in climate science . `` Today at the Washington , D.C. , headquarters of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a free market think tank , you can see Myron Ebell 's philosophy proudly displayed on the walls . MYRON EBELL : They 're all CEI authors . What we 're fighting is the expansion of government . And there are many pretexts for expanding government . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Opposing government action on climate change to defend American freedom is a perfect fit . MYRON EBELL : We felt that if you concede the science is settled and that there 's a consensus , you can not \u2014 the moral high ground has been ceded to the alarmists . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ on camera ] So you had to go to work and break down this consensus . MYRON EBELL : Yes . And we did it because we believed that the consensus was phony . We believed that the so-called global warming consensus was not based on science , but was a political consensus , which included a number of scientists . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ voice-over ] In 2009 , agreement on global warming seemed part of the solid wave of enthusiasm that elected Barack Obama . With the changing of the guard in Washington , there was a bipartisan call to action , a sense of inevitability . HOUSE SERGEANT AT ARMS : Madam Speaker , the president of the United States ! JOHN HOCKENBERRY : An idea that for years had struggled for attention in Congress would get its moment of truth . Pres . BARACK OBAMA : So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : The president backed the so-called cap-and-trade approach , a system of regulations and financial incentives to eventually reduce the emission of carbon into the atmosphere . [ on camera ] It seemed there was consensus on climate change . Sen. JOHN KERRY ( D ) , Massachusetts : There was an uneasy consensus , but the people who have always objected to change had not yet really engaged . And because of the consensus , because there was a sense that there was going to be movement , that galvanized the action of the people who oppose it . MYRON EBELL : The American people had n't focused on these issues until it actually came to a vote in Congress on a bill to implement these policies . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ voice-over ] The soft consensus for taking action ran into the bitter partisan divisions in Congress . Congressional hearings on cap-and-trade would become a stage where opposing views would get equal time . Rep. EDWARD MARKEY ( D-MA ) , Chair , Subcmt . on Energy & Environment : Professor Schrag , you 've just heard what Dr. Michaels said\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Pro cap-and-trade lawmakers would call leading climate scientists and policy makers to make the argument for action now . Prof. DANIEL SCHRAG , Earth and Planetary Sciences , Harvard Univ . : It 's very clear from that estimate that , in fact , we 're in for bigger trouble . THOMAS R. KARL , Dir . , NOAA 's National Climatic Data Center : One of the things that we 've already seen is many observed changes in the climate\u2014 Gen. GORDON R. SULLIVAN ( Ret . ) , Assn . of the United States Army : Global climate change is a serious threat to our national security . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : The skeptics had their own witnesses . They testified that nothing was settled and that global warming might actually be good for the planet . Rep. JOHN SHIMKUS ( R ) , Illinois : Say that again ? Carbon dioxide is what ? CHRISTOPHER MONCKTON : It 's plant food . Rep. JOHN SHIMKUS : It 's plant food . CHRISTOPHER MONCKTON : Yes . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : The testimony of the skeptics argued for a timeout .

In the six years since co-founding Solar Energy World , he has seen the solar-panel installation company grow from just three employees to more than 50 . \u201c The economics work . We can finance programs for people , we can make it so that solar can beat utility and the bigger thing is that there is a lot of job creation , \u201d Mirkin said . Energy summit President Barack Obama highlighted this growth in the solar industry during Monday \u2019 s National Clean Energy Summit , noting the United States generates 20 times as much solar power as it did in 2008 . \u201c The world \u2019 s largest solar installation came online last year , with 9 million solar panels , generating enough electricity to power more than 100,000 homes with clean , renewable energy \u2013 not in Germany , not in China , not in Saudi Arabia \u2013 right here in the United States of America , \u201d Obama said . Just a day after returning from his Martha \u2019 s Vineyard vacation , Obama was on a plane to Las Vegas , where he announced initiatives aimed at making renewable energy sources , including solar , more affordable for American households . And as the Iran nuclear debate and the U.S. presidential campaign heat up , the U.S. leader is keeping his focus on the fight against climate change , an issue he has long called the greatest threat to national security . Just weeks after announcing an ambitious plan to cut carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants , Obama is rebuffing opponents in the Republican Party and fossil fuel industry who say such measures hurt the economy , and embarking on a climate change tour that takes him from Nevada to New Orleans to Alaska . Arctic visit Obama will be the first sitting U.S. president to visit Alaska 's Arctic region next week , where he will highlight the effects of global warming . Benton Strong , with the Center for American Progress , described what Obama will see when he visits the Arctic Circle . `` Some villagers and natives ... are literally seeing their villages melt into the ocean . He [ the president ] is also going to go the place where there [ is ] more acreage of wildfire damage than any other place in the country , so he is going to be able to see some of the impacts of climate change , \u201d Strong said . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest says during the president 's visit to New Orleans Thursday , he will not only focus on the \u201c remarkable revival \u201d of the city 10 years after Hurricane Katrina , but the need to make infrastructure more resilient to climate change , as more and more coastal areas deal with rising sea levels . \u201c I think we have been pretty clear that there is not any one weather event that can be directly attributed to climate change but there is no denying what scientists tell us , which is that that there is reason to be concerned about these storms getting worse and more violent , \u201d Earnest told reporters Wednesday . Strong , formerly with the Climate Action Plan , said given the opposition in the Republican-dominated Congress , the president has felt the need to step up on the issue , at the domestic and international levels . 'Part of his legacy ' \u201c That has shown over the last couple of years with historic agreements with China , India , etc . , \u201d Strong said . \u201c When you look 30 , 40 , 50 years out , him addressing climate change and leading the world on climate change will probably be the largest part of his legacy . \u201d As for Mirkin , the Solar Energy World vice president , he said he does not understand opposition to government initiatives focused on renewable energy , noting the fossil fuel industry has received subsidies for decades . \u201c Solar has kind of been drawn into the political battle , and it shouldn \u2019 t be . For the record I am a Republican , but I believe in solar for a number of reasons , the economics , the environment . I have children and I care about their future , `` he said .

The White House cited thawing permafrost that has damaged military facilities in Alaska and heavy rains that caused $ 64 million in damages to an Army installation in the Southwest.Those same forces could also damage civilian infrastructure , he said . `` Along our coasts , thousands of miles of highways , roads , railways and energy facilities are all vulnerable , `` he said . `` It 's estimated that a further increase in sea level of just one foot by the end of this century could cost our nation $ 200 billion . `` The speech added an urgent tone to the White House 's ambitious climate change strategy . In March , Obama announced a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 . The next month , Obama pitched his plan as a job creator that would train 75,000 solar workers.During his speech on Wednesday , Obama also warned about the need for increased military awareness in the Arctic . Melting glaciers have opened waterways for fishing and oil exploration , which could cause conflict as Russia , Norway , Canada , the U.S. and other countries enter newly accessible territory.Climate change could also stress U.S. energy infrastructure , the White House said , as electricity use goes up during hot summer weather and extreme weather events damage distribution chains.On a global scale , water scarcity and increased food costs could create unrest in countries with few resources and weak governments , he said , citing scarce resources as one of the reasons that Boko Haram rose in Nigeria.Obama 's climate change plan faces resistance from Republicans in Congress . The President took time to address those critics . `` I know there are still some folks back in Washington who refuse to believe that climate change as real , `` he said . `` We can not and must not ignore a peril that can affect generations . `` Keith WagstaffKeith Wagstaff is a contributing writer at NBC News .
