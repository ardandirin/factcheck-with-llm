It has been the subject of three lawsuits from former \"students\" who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire.","The audiobook is from 2006, when it was not obvious that the real estate market was about to tank but there was concern that inflated prices had produced a bubble that might burst, dropping values.","In the recording, Trump is being interviewed. He's asked, \"There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?\"","\"Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy,\" Trump responded. \"You know, if you're in a good cash position \u2014 which I'm in a good cash position today \u2014 then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.\"","\"If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money,\" he said in thesection posted by CNN.","However, Trump immediately added: \"At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit.\"","So Trump didn't think the crash was going to happen.","The only other piece of evidence we've seen: A year later, in 2007, Trumptold the Toronto Globe and Mailthat he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down.","\"People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is,\" he told the paper. \"I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.\"","But once again, it's clear that Trump wasn't predicting the scope of the housing crisis.","\"Donald Trump almost lost his shirt 15 years ago when the North American real estate bubble burst,\" the story begins. \"The 2007 version of that disaster will be much more benign, the real estate magnate predicts. . .  'We're talking very minor (problems) compared with the depression of the early 1990s,' Mr. Trump said.\"","The Globe and Mail story said he was advising investors to take advantage of the situation by buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.","It's all part of the philosophy that any wise investor uses: buy low and sell high.","The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for reaction to Warren's statement.","Our ruling"]}

And there is no evidence Harris plans to force people to surrender their guns. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)","The claim appears to be a mischaracterization of a pledge Harris made during a CNN Presidential Town Hall in April 2019.","\"Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action,\" Harris saidduring the town hall.","Harris continued, clarifying what her executive action would encompass.","\"And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns,\" Harris said. \"I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license.\"","During the town hall, Harris did not discuss confiscating guns using law enforcement officers. What\u2019s more, a commitment to use \"executive action\" canrefer to more than just executive orders, as the Washington Post reported.","At another campaign event in August 2019 in Las Vegas, Harris reiterated her pledge to take action on guns within 100 days of taking office. At that event, she said she wouldalso use executive action to implement\"a ban on the importation of assault rifles into our country.\"","In a follow-up question, Harris wasasked what enforcement of an assault rifles ban might look like. A reporter is heard off-camera asking, \"Does it involve law enforcement essentially going to people\u2019s houses looking for specific banned guns? Does it involve perhaps creating a database of people who are legal gun owners? What kind of process are we talking about here?\"","Harris answered by referencing her experience as attorney general in California, when she said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns by going to the doors of people who were both \"found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others\" and were also \"on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction.\"","\"I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing. We\u2019re talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues,\" Harris said.","Harris did not say she planned to send law enforcement officers to the homes of all gun owners, as the post suggests.","When we first spotted the false quote being shared Aug. 11 on a Facebook page called YET-iheart-NRA, PolitiFact reached out to the page administrator to ask what evidence they had to support the claim. Someone with the Facebook page responded, pointing us toan article from the blog Law Enforcement Today. That article referenced an exchange between Biden and Harris in the September 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate,found here.","In it, debate moderator David Muir of ABC\u2019s World News Tonight pointed out that Harris said she planned to use executive action to ban imports of AR-15 assault weapons if Congress did not act quickly enough. Muir explained that Biden had expressed doubts about the future president\u2019s \"constitutional authority\" to ban assault weapons via executive order, which Harris had not committed to doing.","When asked if Biden\u2019s stated concern had a point, Harris jokingly replied, \"I mean I would just say, \u2018Hey Joe, instead of saying no we can\u2019t, let\u2019s say yes we can.\u2019\" Here again, there is no evidence she made the statement that is being attributed to her. (The post made by YET-iheart-NRA appears to have been removed since we inquired about it.)","Other fact-checking organizationsdebunked similar claimsthatcirculated online in 2019, but Harris\u2019 new role as vice presidential candidate caused the claim to reemerge. Fact-checking organizations havecontinued debunkingthe claimafter it reappeared."]}

I appreciate the fact that you called it an assault. But I\u2019m going back to then-Ambassador (Susan) Rice five days later going on the Sunday shows and, what I would say, is purposefully misleading the American public. Why wasn\u2019t that known? And again, I appreciate the fact that the transparency of this hearing, but why weren\u2019t we transparent to that point in time?\"","Clinton: \"Well, first of all, senator, I would say that once the assault happened, and once we got our people rescued and out, our most immediate concern was, number one, taking care of their injuries. As I said, I still have a DS (Diplomatic Security) agent at Walter Reed seriously injured \u2014 getting them into Frankfurt, Ramstein to get taken care of, the FBI going over immediately to start talking to them.

Number two, I would recommend highly you read both what the ARB said about it and the classified ARB because, even today, there are questions being raised. Now, we have no doubt they were terrorists, they were militants, they attacked us, they killed our people. But what was going on and why they were doing what they were doing is still unknown \u2014\"","Johnson: \"No, again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and that something sprang out of that \u2014 an assault sprang out of that \u2014 andthat was easily ascertained that that was not the fact, and the American people could have known that within days and they didn\u2019t know that.\"","Clinton: \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans.Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they\u2019d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The IC has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out. But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we\u2019ll figure out what was going on in the meantime.\"","Johnson: \"Okay. Thank you, Madame Secretary.\"","So the transcript makes a few points fairly clear:","Johnson was the guy who got Clinton riled up by asking why she didn\u2019t call Benghazi survivors;","Clinton did say \"What difference at this point does it make?\" in response to that question.","But Clinton also did provide Johnson other answers. She said her priority was figuring out how to rescue those still at the compound and how to treat their injuries, not pressing them for information. She said it wasn\u2019t appropriate for the State Department to talk to them before FBI interviews. Finally, she said her department and the administration were still trying to sort out the confusion in the days following the attacks.","Our ruling"]}

A person who requests protection while still overseas, and then is given permission to enter the U.S., is called a refugee.","An asylee, or a persongranted asylum, is authorized to work in the United States, can apply for a Social Security card, can request permission to travel overseas and can petition to bring family members to the United States. Asylees may also be eligible for federal or Office of Refugee Resettlement benefits, such as Medicaid or Refugee Medical Assistance.","After one year, an asylee may apply for permanent resident status (i.e., a green card). Once the individual becomes a permanent resident, he or she must wait four years to apply for citizenship.","Testimony from border patrol agents and federal officials at Senate Homeland Security Committee hearings has included first-hand testimony from border agents and federal officials on the migrants presenting themselves at the border, citingfearof being accosted, forced into or killed by Central American gangs.","Others have claimed they cannot return to their country of origin because of fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a political social group, or political opinion.","TheU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Serviceswebsite details a variety of guidelines on how to proceed when migrants arrive at the border seeking asylum, including details on the definition for \"credible fear of persecution or torture\":","Q.What is a Credible Fear of Persecution?","A.A \"significant possibility\" that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if returned to your country.","Q.What Is a Credible Fear of Torture?","A.A \"significant possibility\" that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you would be subject to torture if returned to your country.","Asylum denials","Contrary to what Johnson\u2019s claim suggests,denials of asylumby immigration judges have been rising.","As of the end of September 2016, overall asylum denial rates for fiscal year 2016 had risen to 57 percent. The total number of asylum denials from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2016 was 125,066, or 49.8 percent, according to Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access ClearinghouseTracImmigration.","Among the number of Immigration Court asylum cases decided during fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2016, Mexico had the highest number of denials, with 12,028, or 89.6 percent. Others with high rates of denials include El Salvador with 11,546, or 82.9 percent; Honduras with 7,350, or 80.3 percent; Haiti with 1,599, or 80.1 percent; and the Dominican Republic, with 407 denials, or 87 percent.","A 2017 analysis byReutersillustrated that the difference between an asylum seeker being granted residency or ordered deported depends largely on which judge hears the case, and where.","Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TracImmigration), confirmed that report.","The median level of asylum decision disparity that asylum seekers face is now over 56 percentage points. That is, the assignment of the judge for the typical asylum seeker could alter the odds of receiving asylum by this magnitude. For example, while the specific ranges differed by court, the typical asylum seeker might have only a 15 percent chance of being granted asylum all the way up to a 71 percent chance depending on the particular judge to whom their case is assigned.","In addition, Johnson\u2019s argument that \"we don\u2019t send them back\" comes with a major caveat. Under international law, the United States can\u2019t simply \"send them back,\" according to aYale Law Schoolreport:","Summary removal procedures put the United States at risk of violating the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids states from forcibly repatriating individuals who have legitimate claims for international protection. To satisfy its obligations under the Refugee Convention, the United States must provide arriving noncitizens a genuine opportunity to pursue asylum claims prior to their removal.","A Trump directive calls for expediting eligibility claims of those attempting to stay in the United States andpromptly deportingthose whose claims are rejected.","Unaccompanied minors","Things work somewhat differently when children -- \"unaccompanied minors,\" in immigration parlance -- arrive at the border themselves.","Those procedures are covered by theTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.","In those cases, the children are screened and may be placed in the care of a sponsor \u2013 usually a parent, relative, or family friend \u2013 who can care for them while their immigration cases proceed.","If the child fails to show up for a hearing, he or she can be ordered deported. However, deporting unaccompanied minors who are no shows in court is no easy task, because some do not stay at the addresses provided to the government and disappear into the general population.","Expert opinion","We also turned to Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law, who made it clear it\u2019s not as simple as saying the right words and being allowed to stay.","\"If they pass the credible fear interview, they will be placed in removal proceedings and have an opportunity to apply for asylum in immigration court. If their case is denied, they will be deported,\" he said. \"In some cases, (authorities) may choose to parole the person into the country instead of keeping him or her detained, but that is very much the exception, not the rule.\"","Our rating"]}

At the federal level, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosivesdoes not regulate private salesas it does those involving licensed firearm dealers.","Some states \u2014 including California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington \u2014 require all private sales be conducted through firearm dealers, who then retain sales records, according to theGiffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a research and advocacy organization. They call that the \"most comprehensive policy option.\"","Other states give private sellers the option of going through law enforcement directly for the background check. The record-keeping requirements vary, with some states leaving that to the individual selling the gun and others requiring transfers be reported to local law enforcement.","RELATED:Can you buy a gun in Wisconsin after a felony or restraining order?","In Wisconsin, any universal background check would have to be integrated with the current system for gun dealer sales, which splits background check responsibilities based on the type of gun.","The state Department of Justice handlesbackground checks for handgun sales, while long gun sales go through theNational Criminal Background Check Systems, run by the FBI.","What information is submitted to the government","Fitzgerald says he objects to universal background checks because of the new requirements they would place on private gun sales, so let\u2019s examine how those could look.","If Wisconsin implemented a comprehensive universal background check system, routing all sales through dealers, the flow of information to authorities would be the same as it is now for dealer sales.","For long gun sales, dealers fill outATF form 4473\u2014 which includes the gun make and serial number \u2014 and submit it to the FBI\u2019s criminal background system. The FBI conducts the background check but isrequired by federal lawto destroy identifying information on the purchaser and gun within 24 hours.","The dealer is then required to keep a copy of the 4473 form for at least 20 years. After that point, or if the dealer goes out of business, the form is turned over to the ATF. Butfederal lawforbids the ATF from storing these records in a searchable format or otherwise using them \"to establish any system for the registration of firearms.\" The records are retained usingdecades-old microfilm technology, makinggun tracinga painstaking, manual process.","For handguns, Wisconsin dealers still fill out and retain the form 4473, but background checks are done by the Wisconsin Department of Justice.State law requiresdealers to submit the name, date of birth, gender, Social Security number and other identifying information to the Wisconsin DOJ. But the agency does not receive or store serial numbers or any other firearm information, said spokeswoman Gillian Drummond.","So under a comprehensive system, serial numbers would \u2014 eventually \u2014 make it to a government agency. But it is typically decades before that happens, and the agency is then prohibited from turning those into a database.","If Wisconsin opted for a less comprehensive system, less information would go to the government. For example, if the state DOJ were tasked with all background checks for private sales and private sellers were required to maintain their own records (as in Illinois), no serial numbers would be submitted to any government entity for any private gun sales.","Would a gun registry violate the Second Amendment?","All of this brings us to the last element of Fitzgerald\u2019s claim \u2014 that submitting serial numbers to government officials violates the Second Amendment.","Courts have said that isn\u2019t true.","Six states and the District of Columbia already require registration of some or all firearms, according to the Giffords Law Center.","\"These state laws have been in place for decades and have not been overturned on the grounds that they violate an individual\u2019s Second Amendment rights,\" saidDaniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. \"Nothing in any Supreme Court ruling to date would suggest that a government requirement that gun owners provide serial numbers for the guns they purchase or own to government officials violates the Second Amendment.\"","For example, a challenge to the Washington, D.C. registration requirement in 2015 waslargely upheldby a federal appeals court. The ruling stripped away some elements of the law but left untouched the basic requirement that guns be registered.","Our ruling"]}

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., bristled when NBC host Chuck Todd suggested Cotton\u2019s foreign policy positions align more closely with Clinton than with Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump.","\"I can assure you that I am not very close to Hillary Clinton,\" Cotton responded. \"She has been responsible for many of the worst decisions of the Obama administration. She was literally present when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia.\"","Cotton\u2019s list of her failings continued, but his comment about Russia invading Georgia caught our eye, and we decided to look a little closer.","Russia and Georgia","Cotton\u2019s claim focuses on the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the semi-autonomous regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.","Tensions and violencebetween ethnic Georgians, South Ossetians and Abkhazians ebbed and flowed after the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1990. Under the USSR, South Ossetia and Abkhazia enjoyed substantial autonomy. Newly independent Georgian nationalists declared a unified nation with no internal borders.","In 1991, Georgian forces occupied the South Ossetian capital, but resistance by Russian-backed fighters led to a stalemate. In 1992, all parties agreed to a ceasefire, which included a Russian-led peacekeeping force. There was a similar pattern of hostilities in Abkhazia that resulted in a similar solution. The presence of peacekeepers and international monitors worked for about a decade.","Calm unravelled in 2004 with the election of a more nationalist leader in Georgia. There was aggression on both sides. Violence grew and on Aug. 7, 2008, after Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia shelled ethnically Georgian villages, and the Georgian government sent in its army to take control of the region. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia.","Clashes continued for a week, drawing in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Open conflict ended on Aug. 12, 2008. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step.","Russian troops largely withdrew from Georgian soil, although some forces remained in several Georgian cities until about October 2008.","The reset","Jump forward to March 2009 to pick up the other point in Cotton\u2019s statement.","Newly elected President Barack Obama had campaigned that he would put relations with Russia on a less confrontational footing. Most of his focus was on scaling back the nuclear arsenals of both nations. (He promised to win Russian agreement to continue themonitoring and verification rules under the STARTI Treaty that were due to expire in 2009.)","As part of that initiative, on March 6, 2009, in Geneva, Switzerland, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov a red button. The button was supposed to have word \"reset\" written on it in Russian. But the Americans got it wrong -- the word translated to \"overcharged.\"","Counting the months","So Cotton has the basics of the story largely correct, though he\u2019s cutting off the edges.","Russian troops did participate in military activities on Georgian soil, but troops were already in place as part of a brokered peace settlement. And the Russians didn\u2019t necessarily initiate hostilities.","And while Cotton said the Americans hit the \"reset\" button \"a few months\" after the Russian invasion, the reality is it took place almost six months after the week-long conflict had ended.","An invasion with a twist","Susan Allen, director of the Center for Peacemaking Practice at George Mason University, calls Russia\u2019s action an invasion because in early August 2008, Russia didn't consider South Ossetia to be an independent country.","But Allen told us that beyond that legal definition, the details muddy the picture. Georgia made the first large military move. On top of that, Russian soldiers were already on the ground in South Ossetia.","\"Russia had had a longstanding role as part of a peacekeeping force separating the Georgians and South Ossetians,\" Allen said. \"Yes, Russia invaded Georgia, and, yes, there is a lot more to the story.\"","Law professor Kenneth Anderson at American University put a lot of weight on the rest of the story. Right after the ceasefire, Anderson urged western powers to push back hard against Russian expansionism. But he reminded people of the ethnic cleansing that took place at the hands of Georgian nationalists in the 1990s, saying it was as extreme as anything he had seen in the war in the former Yugoslavia.","\"The facts of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are not simply a narrative of Russia stirring up trouble in an otherwise untroubled corner of the world,\" Andersonwrote in a 2008 article. \"This conflict got started 15 years ago, and although on again and off again, it has never stopped.  Neither its existence nor its persistence are due to Russian imperial expansion alone.\"","For Cotton to bring up Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia might invoke more recent memories of Russia\u2019s clear aggression in Ukraine when it seized control of the Crimean peninsula. But the circumstances were quite different, as was the western reaction. The Crimean seizure produced hard sanctions against Russia, including expulsion from the G-8. In contrast, in 2008, the George W. Bush administration made only cautious moves to register its disapproval of Russia.","David L. Phillips, director of Columbia University\u2019s program on peace-building and rights,told PolitFactin 2014 that \"there was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that.\"","Regarding the impact of the \"reset\", some observers say it helped. Political scientist Andrew Kuchins at the Center for Strategic and International Studieswrote in 2011that relations between Russia and America \"steadily improved.\" Kuchins credits the diplomatic shift with producing a new START treaty and winning Russian support for stronger sanctions against Iran.","Our ruling"]}

The victim told the court she feared Kramer might rape her after she resisted his advances, which included shoving her against a car, forcibly kissing her, putting his hands up her shirt and grabbing her groin.","The victim did not report it at the time, but came forward after Kramer allegedly groped a legislative aide\u2019s breasts and bragged about his sexual prowess to a female lobbyist at a 2014 fundraiser in Washington, D.C.","Like us on Facebook.

You're trying to convey to the judge that this one incident doesn\u2019t necessarily portray everything about his (the defendant\u2019s) character, and that is one of the big factors the court has to consider in sentencing.","Paul Bucher, who does criminal defense work and is the former district attorney in Waukesha County, disagreed, saying some letters explicitly ask for leniency or no jail time and Vukmir\u2019s doesn't:","We do character letters all the time because all the court really knows about the client is what is in the criminal complaint.

In a recent tweet, the Republican National Committee blamed rising crime on Democrats.","\"Crime is escalating to a level we haven\u2019t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats\u2019 defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies,\" Republicanstweeted June 29.","Crime is escalating to a level we haven\u2019t seen in decades as a direct result of Democrats\u2019 defund the police movement and Biden-Harris open-border policies.","We asked the RNC for the data behind the claims in the tweet. Their response included nothing on the link to police defunding. On the open border part, they pointed to news coverage about an increase infentanyl seizuresat the border,high-speed chasesin South Texas, and FBI directorChristopher Wraytalking about an epidemic of drug smuggling and other illegal activity at the border.","The RNC tweet is rife with inaccuracies. But its biggest flaw is the unfounded assertion that crime rate trends were a \"direct result\" of Democratic policies.","Homicides increased in 2020. It\u2019s possible that the toll could have topped 19,000 last year.","But the RNC tweet is not narrowly about rising homicides. It encompasses several other claims that are flawed:","\"Open-border policies\":The articles the RNC cited said nothing linking activity at the border to a spike in the national incidence of murders or other crimes. We found no independent research that argued that point.","Criminologist and law professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah noted that when murders began to increase rapidly in mid-2020, immigration was stable or declining.","\"And, obviously, Democrats did not control immigration policy in May 2020,\" Cassell said. \"So any linkage between the 2020 homicide increase and immigration policies seems quite dubious.\"","Historic highs:The RNC tweet talked about crime reaching levels not seen in decades. Not only do they lack the data to confirm that, but based on the FBI\u2019s latest available data for homicides and other preliminary data, the U.S. is not on pace to reach the heights seen in the mid-1990s.","\"Defund the police\":The RNC tweet suggested that \"defund the police\" is a core Democratic policy. It is not. A handful of Democrats have spoken out for it, but during the 2020 campaign, candidate Joe Bidenrejectedthe movement. And his 2022 budget requested an increase of $304 million for police to build ties within the communities they patrol.","Some Democratic-led cities did cut police budgets last year, but not many. Among the50 largest cities, police spending as a percentage of general expenditures went up an average of 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021.","The RNC tweet speaks of crime broadly, but it\u2019s homicides in particular that have caused alarm since a sharp rise in the summer of 2020. That coincided with the anti-police-violence protests that spread across the country in June following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The calls to defund the police gained prominence the same month.","One problem in talking about crime at this moment is that no one yet has a national picture of crime for 2020, let alone the first half of 2021. The FBI\u2019s annual Uniform Crime Report is the most comprehensive data set, and the FBI hasn\u2019t published the 2020 edition yet.","Other data sets lack the scope of the FBI\u2019s full assessment, but they all point in the same direction: Homicides are up.","Apreliminary FBI crime reportfor 154 cities says murders rose 10% in the first quarter of 2021 compared with a year earlier. TheMajor Cities Chiefs Associationfound a 29% rise in homicides for 63 cities in the first quarter of 2021. And the latest report fromCouncil on Criminal Justice, an independent source of crime data, looked at 24 cities and found homicides rose by 24% in the first quarter.","The topline numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story, however.","For example, in the first-quarter FBI release on 154 cities, the increase in homicides was concentrated in 40% of the cities. The remaining 60% saw murders drop or stay the same. As for violent crime generally \u2014 including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault \u2014 the number remained just about the same across the full group of cities, undercutting the RNC\u2019s broad-brush claim about escalating crime.","The Council on Criminal Justice\u2019s data on weekly police reports found that homicide rates generally fell after October 2020 \u2014 from a bit over 5 deaths per 100,000 to about 3 per 100,000 by March 2021.","That could reflect seasonal changes; homicides tend to fall in the cooler months. But the report\u2019s authors say other unknown factors could be at work.","The RNC\u2019s claim that rising crime was a \"direct result\" of Democratic policies lacks evidence, and experts say it ignores some of the major events of 2020 that also likely had an effect on crime.","\"The pandemic hit especially hard in exactly those neighborhoods where a lot of violence happens anyway,\" said City University of New York criminologist Candace McCoy. \"Services that connect with teens were shutting down. Families were hit with people getting sick, some of them dying. More young adults were left to themselves.\"","Criminologist Eileen Ahlin at Penn State-Harrisburg noted that the economic downturn also mattered.","\"Unemployment and declining mental health routinely affect crime rates,\" Ahlin said. \"Last year we saw both at play.\"","On top of the pandemic and the disruptions it brought, there were the nationwide protests spurred by the death of George Floyd.","Cassell at the University of Utah said that played a role, because it made police less likely to engage with people who might commit violence.","\"Police pulled back from the kinds of aggressive steps that are often needed to most effectively fight homicides,\" Cassell said.","Cassell also said that dealing with marches could have taken police away from other activities. Researchers disagree whether the protests themselves had any effect. Regardless, Cassell called the GOP link between crime and a defund policy \"dubious.\"","Even the pandemic and the protests might not fully explain the trend in homicides. As the Council on Criminal Justice report noted, the \"homicide increase actually began in 2019, prior to the pandemic and well before protests against police violence spread across the country.\"","Looking at the first three months of 2020, murders rose 20% from a year earlier. The pandemic shutdown didn\u2019t take place until mid-March, and the protests didn\u2019t begin until late May."]}

But an ideological cross-section of economists agreed that the recession was primarily caused by a housing bubble that turned into a financial crisis, and that it was caused by many factors more significant than low taxes.","So for Clinton to say that tax cuts for the rich \"in large part\" caused the Great Recession is a significant exaggeration. We rate it Mostly False."],"full_article":["During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton tried to fix blame for the Great Recession on a cherished part of conservative economic policy -- tax cuts.","\"Trickle-down did not work,\" Clinton said, referring to a derisive name for tax cuts that dates from the presidency of Ronald Reagan. \"It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn\u2019t worked.\"","Later in the debate. Clinton doubled down on that argument, saying, \"Well, let\u2019s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.\"","We had usually heard from experts that the Great Recession stemmed most directly from the bursting of a housing bubble that led to a financial-sector meltdown. So we wondered whether economists thought Clinton\u2019s argument held water.","First, some history: President George W. Bush enacted two rounds of tax cuts, though critics said that richer Americans benefited disproportionately. It is these cuts -- coming on top of previous rounds of tax cuts for wealthier Americans -- that play a prominent role in Clinton\u2019s assertion at the debate.","Most, though not all, of the economists we contacted -- liberals, conservatives and in between -- expressed skepticism about the linkage Clinton made. (For their part, our friends at theWashington PostFact Checker gave the claimThree Pinocchiosout of a possible four, in large part based on the analysis of a663-page reportfrom 2011 by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.)","That said, when we contacted the Clinton campaign, they stood by the assertion. Two of the campaign\u2019s arguments stand out as plausible:","\u2022 Bush administration regulators took their eyes off Wall Street.","\u2022 Bush\u2019s tax and budget policies fostered income inequality that, in turn, promoted unsustainable investments by the wealthy in homes owned by families with stagnating income and uncertain abilities to pay them back.","We found one expert who strongly sided with Clinton\u2019s analysis -- Robert S. McElvaine, a historian at Millsaps College who has written about the Great Depression and the Great Recession. (ThePost\u2019s Fact Checker found a couple more that had been put in touch through the campaign.)","\"It\u2019s not the tax cuts for the rich per se, but their effect of concentrating income at the very top that was the major cause of the Great Depression,\" and, in turn, the Great Recession, McElvaine said. When income is too concentrated, he said, the rest of the population doesn\u2019t have enough to maintain sufficient demand, and the economy suffers, he said.","So there is at least some support for a lack of Wall Street regulation and income inequality for setting the stage for the financial crisis that spawned the recession.","However, the  economists we checked with expressed skepticism -- some strongly so -- about Clinton\u2019s assertion that the recession emerged \"in large part\" due to tax policies.","On the left, Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research, said he wouldn\u2019t just call tax cuts a minor factor in causing the recession -- he said he \"can't think of any way they were a factor at all.\" If anything, he said, \"the conventional wisdom goes the other way -- tax cuts tend to increase the deficit, which pushes up interest rates and in turn drags down house prices.\"","On the right, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. \"Hillary is spouting nonsense,\" he said. \"No economic theory links tax cuts -- or, for that matter, tax increases -- to financial market meltdowns.\"","Other economists we contacted echoed these sentiments.","\"Clinton is on solid ground criticizing Bush\u2019s tax cuts, but blaming them for the recession goes too far,\" said Bruce Bartlett, a former Ronald Reagan aide who has sometimesbroken with some conservative orthodoxies. \"One can certainly say that the Bush tax cuts failed to raise economic growth or lower unemployment to any significant degree, and one can argue that the Reagan tax cuts were not especially stimulative as well. But to argue that the Bush tax cuts caused the 2008-09 recession is a stretch.\"","Harvey Rosen, a Princeton University economist who was an official in the administrations of both Bush and his father, said that tax cuts seem like an unlikely culprit, because \"historically we\u2019ve had relatively low rates without terrible -- or any -- recessions.\" He added that low tax rates \"would not make my list of the top 10 reasons for the recession.\"","Instead, Rosen pointed to a \"housing bubble in the United States and Europe that was fed by excess liquidity and poorly regulated mortgage markets.\" This became a problem, he said, when large financial institutions that had huge amounts of assets dependent on high housing prices found themselves with too little capital to stave off failure when the market crashed.","\"After a number of financial firms failed, it caused a panic, and confidence in the financial system collapsed,\" Rosen said. \"With the collapse in confidence came a collapse in credit markets -- no one was able to borrow -- which ultimately caused a contraction of the real economy.\"","Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless added another factor: the irrational psychologies of the bubble, on the part of both homebuyers and lenders who felt empowered to pursue risky arrangements in the absence of strict regulation. \"By the middle of the 2000-2010 decade, a great many loans were made that prudent lenders would not have made in the 1990s or ever the early 2000s,\" Burtless said.","This, in turn, led to the \"end of a housing boom, a sharp decline in housing prices, widespread mortgage defaults, widespread mortgage securities defaults, and a lack of assets to cover the losses at nine large financial institutions -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, the CitiCorp holding company, and the AIG holding company,\" said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business.","Our ruling"]}

Crimea remained part of Russia.","1917: Crimea briefly became a sovereign state before becoming a base for the White Army of anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian War.","1921: The peninsula, now called the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, became part of the Soviet Union.","1942: Nazi Germany took control of Crimea.","1944: Joesph Stalin forcibly deported all Muslim Tatars, a group of 300,000 who had lived on the peninsula for centuries, due to members\u2019 alleged cooperation with Germany during World War II.

Jon Tester, D-Mont.","\"Tester believes that we should have a national registration so that the people of Montana should have to ask permission before they purchase a gun, ask permission from the federal government,\" Rosendale, Montana's state auditor, said in a July 31 interview onVoices of Montana.","We decided to investigate whether Tester supports a national gun registry. It turns out the opposite is true.","This point may seem obvious but it bears highlighting: the government does not have a single, consolidated list of all guns and all gun owners across the country, or, what a layperson would call a national gun registry.","\"When people talk about national gun registration, they most commonly are talking about a list of people who own guns lawfully, or a list of the guns that are lawfully owned,\" said David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who hasauthoredseveral books on gun control.","An important caveat, however, is that the National Firearms Act of 1934, which Congress passed in response to that era\u2019s rash of organized crime, did set up a registry for limited types of guns and other weapons. Those included machine guns, which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger; short-barreled rifles or shotguns; disguised guns, like those made to look like a belt buckle; hand grenades; and silencers.","While some might consider the registration of machine guns and silencers to be a national gun registry, that\u2019s inconsistent with common parlance.","Further, Rosendale\u2019s statement alleges Tester supports a registry to apply broadly to \"the people of Montana,\" and Rosendale\u2019s campaign gave no indication he was referring to the narrower National Firearms Act registry.","We asked Rosendale\u2019s campaign for evidence that Tester supports a national gun registry. They pointed us to a vote Testercastin favor of a 2015 amendment sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that failed in the Senate.","Did that measure seek to establish a federal list of guns and their owners?","Not even close.","For the past nearly 20 years, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to run an FBI background check on customers. Would-be purchasers are checked against an FBI list of people prohibited by law from owning guns: those with felony convictions, known illegal aliens and domestic abusers, to name a few categories.","The Feinstein amendment sought to extend the FBI\u2019s list to those on the U.S. government\u2019sconsolidated terror watchlistof known or suspected terrorists, and grant the attorney general discretion to deny them from buying a gun.","The Rosendale campaign\u2019s argument appears to be as follows: Because the terror watchlist has mistakenly listed innocent people, the watchlist could be used as a national gun registry.","Experts dismissed the notion that to deny gun sales to the government\u2019s list of known and suspected terrorists,flawedas it may be, is the same thing as making a federal list of lawfully-owned guns and its owners.","\"The terror watch list is not a gun registry,\" said Philip J. Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University and an expert on gun control. \"In fact, if the Feinstein amendment were passed and enforced, then the terror watch list would be a registry of people who did not have guns!\"","David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University who has written extensively about firearms policy, said the Rosendale campaign\u2019s explanation of the Feinstein amendment doesn\u2019t add up.","\"This simply has involved changing the criteria for passing a background check. It is nothing like a registry,\" Hemenway said. \"He doesn't seem to understand what a registry is.\"","So Rosendale\u2019s central claim is flat wrong \u2014 but he didn\u2019t stop there. Rosendale said the registry Tester allegedly supports would require Montanans to \"ask permission from the federal government\" before they purchase a gun.","Because the alleged gun registry proposal is a fiction, it can have no policy implications. So this extra bit only serves to enhance the claim\u2019s absurdity.","The Rosendale campaign said further that Tester\u2019s votes against several measures means he is tolerant of a national gun registry because these measures would have made it harder to enact one. However \u2014 leaving asidewhetherthesebillswould have done that \u2014 the reality is that Tester\u2019s record shows clear instances where he opposed gun registries.","Testervoted forthe 2013 Manchin-Toomey Amendment, a bipartisan background check plan, whichwe previously foundwould have strengthened federal law prohibiting the creation of a national gun registry.","In 2011, he was among a group of lawmakers whopushedfor a provision to block federal funding from being used to retain gun background check records for more than 24 hours, andvotedin favor of the bill that contained this provision. (Tester expressed concern as early as2006that maintaining such records could be the first step toward a national gun registry).","He also co-signed a 2011letterto President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raising Second Amendment concerns that a proposed U.N. arms trade deal could lead to an \"international gun registry.\" For this, Tester earnedpraisefrom the National Rifle Association for \"stand(ing) on the side of America's 80 million gun owners in opposition to those who want to eliminate our freedoms.\""]}

Rather, it comes from tallying how many people listed at least one of the examples.","Behind the numbers","That is the number Pocan cited, but in doing so he missed some important nuances.","First, the question about changing technology habits wasn't asked of everyone in the sample.","An earlier question asked how much respondents had heard about government collecting information about  \"telephone calls, emails and other online communications as part of efforts to monitor terrorist activity.\" The 87 percent of respondents who said they had heard \"a little\" or \"a lot\" were then asked about changing technology habits.","So that means, in the end, 22 percent -- not 25 percent -- of all of those surveyed said they had made such a change.","Pocan also said the 25 percent of people \"changed their email and phone habits.\" But, as noted, the list had seven categories and did not pair any two of them together.","Pocan also suggested a cause-and-effect relationship between government surveillance programs and  people changing their technology habits.","But the poll only asked whether respondents had changed their technology use \"since learning about U.S. phone and Internet monitoring.\"","For instance, someone may have dropped their landline phone service to save money, but did so some time after they heard of government surveillance.","Research methodology","Beyond Pocan's fumbling with the survey data, some aspects of how the survey was done could have affected the results.","Pew used GfK Group\u2019s national KnowledgePanel survey of 475 adults conducted between November 2014 and January 2015 for the analysis.","KnowledgePanel is a national research sample, weighted to represent the country's demographics.

Tony Evers doesn\u2019t have a sufficient plan. Evers has countered that he\u2019s doing the best he can with the available supply, claiming Vice President Mike Pence had promised vaccines from a federal reserve thatdidn\u2019t actually exist.","Republican Rebecca Kleefisch, a potential 2022 gubernatorial candidate, said Evers is leading an effort that ranks among the worst in the region.","\"Wisconsin is second to last in the Midwest in our vaccination rate and the governor says he\u2019s \u2018satisfied,\u2019\" Kleefisch, the former lieutenant governor under Gov. Scott Walker, said in aJan. 14, 2021, tweet.","Does Wisconsin really rank that poorly?","Let\u2019s dig in.","We\u2019ll leave for another day the question of who\u2019s to blame for the speed of Wisconsin\u2019s vaccine rollout.","But the status is clear \u2014 Wisconsin is among the slowest in the nation. In fact, Kleefisch was over-stating the Midwest ranking.","State-by-state data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed 2.4% of Wisconsin residents received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine as of Jan. 13, the most recent data available when Kleefisch sent out her tweet.","That ranked dead last among the 12 Midwest states. North Dakota and South Dakota led that ranking with more than 5% receiving a first dose, while Ohio and Missouri joined Wisconsin at the bottom, with 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively.","In the preceding days, Wisconsin had ranked second-last in the Midwest.","Nationwide as of Jan. 13, Wisconsin ranked 41st out of all 50 states in vaccination rate, well off the national average of 3.1%.","The ranking only worsened in the ensuing week, with Wisconsin dropping to 44th by Jan. 19 while remaining last in the Midwest,according to the CDC.","Pushing back against Kleefisch\u2019s claim, Evers spokeswoman Britt Cudaback pointed to CDC data on the raw number of vaccinations administered. That showed Wisconsin ranked seventh out of the 12 Midwest states as of Jan. 13.","But that\u2019s not a reasonable way to compare progress when dealing with states that vary dramatically in population. It would be like arguing Texas is the highest-crime state because it has themost prison inmates. The latter may be true, but only because Texas has one of the highest populations. Comparing it to other states requires examining the number of inmates relative to the population (in which case Texas is not first).","That\u2019s where theper capita ratecomes in \u2014 which is the vaccination metric used by theCDCand referenced by Kleefisch.","Cudaback also said Wisconsin\u2019s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population. Vaccines are made available to states based on population, but states are required to store enough doses for everyone in long-term care before any doses can be administered to other groups. State officials say Wisconsin has a higher proportion of long-term care residents than many states and therefore has to build a larger bank before administering vaccines, slowing the process.","That brings us to the second part of Kleefisch\u2019s claim, that Evers is comfortable with where the state stands.","She\u2019s off a bit there, at least in how she framed it.","In aJan. 13 interviewwith WISN-TV, Evers was asked, \"Is this acceptable to you where we\u2019re at\" as a state on vaccinations.","\"Given what we have, we can\u2019t give any more. That\u2019s the issue,\" the governor said. \"Yes, I'm satisfied where we're at because that's all we had.\"","So Evers isn\u2019t necessarily saying he\u2019s satisfied with being second-last (or last). He\u2019s saying he is satisfied with the progress given what he has had to work with.","Whether that\u2019s a valid excuse is a topic for another fact check, as there are of course vaccines on hand in Wisconsin that haven\u2019t yet been administered. But he\u2019s not quite using the word in the same way Kleefisch characterized it.","Cudaback also said Wisconsin\u2019s ability to administer vaccines is limited by its large long-term care population.

Light, a professor at New York University\u2019s Robert Wagner School of Public Service. Once that decision is made, the legal basis for \"the infrastructure of support\" for a presidential transition is in place, Light said.","The president-elect and his team have approximately 11 weeks between Election Day and Inauguration Day to organize the new administration, and prepare to assume national security and homeland security responsibilities from the incumbent, among other tasks, according to a Nov. 13Congressional Research Service report.","In general, presidential transition activities are coordinated by the General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget. Once the president-elect and vice president-elect have been \"ascertained\" by the GSA, federal officials are allowed to provide the transition team with facilities, funds, and services to prepare for the new administration. The money can be spent on salaries, consultants, office supplies, travel expenses and government aircraft.","The agency\u2019s current administrator,Emily Murphy, has not signed the required ascertainment document yet.","\"The administrator is striving to adhere to the language and intent of the law, as well as precedent,\" GSA spokeswoman Pamela Pennington told PolitiFact. \"Please note that the law provides no process or standard by which ascertainment is made.\"","Prior to Trump, departing presidents have generally adhered to the tradition of a smooth and straightforward transition. The laws governing the transition have enshrined the idea that the outgoing administration \"had a responsibility to hand off matters in a considered and organized fashion,\" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that runs a Center for Presidential Transition that advises on best practices.","RELATED: How we know Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential race","Light pointed to astatementby then-GSA Administrator David J. Barram in testimony before Congress in December 2000, at a time when the presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore was so close that it had to effectively be decided by the Supreme Court.","\"While the Act gives no explicit criteria or deadlines for making this ascertainment, as the legislative history demonstrates, Congress made it perfectly clear that if there is \u2018any question\u2019 of who the winner is \u2018in a close contest,\u2019 this determination should not be made,\" Barram testified at the time.","In aninterview this week on CNN, Barram said the situation now is \"dramatically different\" than what he faced in 2000. \"To me, it's clear that we should be recognizing Joe Biden as the president-elect,\" he said on Nov. 19.","The fuzziness in the law has meant that the ascertainment has traditionally been viewed \"as pro forma,\" Stier said. \"The expectation was that it was important and should be done without having to demonstrate an extraordinary level of proof.\"","The absence of a clear concession and Trump\u2019s continuing efforts to fight the election results are the primary reason why the Trump-to-Biden transition has been so rocky, experts said.","\"For 220 years, our country has had a peaceful transition of power,\" said Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied transition issues. Trump has not only refused to concede, but he has \"perpetuated the myth that the election was somehow fraudulent,\" she said.","Stier argues that, even in the absence of a formal ascertainment, the Trump administration could voluntarily start doing some things to help the incoming administration get ready, such as sharing intelligence, encouraging meetings with public health officials, and allowing security-clearance investigations to begin.","\"This is not about some abstract decision that GSA has to make \u2014 it\u2019s about choices being made to pursue a policy of noncooperation,\" Stier said.","Light lays the blame on Trump, not on Murphy, who he says is required to answer to a vague law.","\"Everything here hinges on good faith,\" Light said. \"The GSA administrator may have been well within the boundaries of the statute to deny a formal launch decision, but Trump's interference and threats have poisoned the cooperative relationship that has long marked the process, even after bitter campaigns such as 1980, when Reagan bested Carter for the presidency.\"","RELATED: How narrow was Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Donald Trump?"]}

We went in search of the examples cited by Nelson.","Obamacare navigators","First, some background on Obamacare navigators.","The Affordable Care Act awarded $8 million in federal grants to eight Florida entities to hire navigators, including theUniversity of South Florida-based program Florida Covering Kids & Families andPinellas County. Florida state leaders declined to set up their own marketplace or work with the federal government to run it together, leaving the job to the federal government.","Navigators must go through at least 20 hours of training and befingerprintedbefore they can become certified. Their job is to offer impartial information about health plans and the availability of tax credits and subsidies to offset the cost of a plan. They are not allowed to direct consumers to specific plans or receive payments from insurers, businesses or consumers.","Navigators will begin enrolling people within days as the insurance marketplaces known as exchanges launch Oct. 1.","Medicare\/Medicaid counselors","In our search for something similar to Obamacare navigators, we started with Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors, and Medicaid, which serves the poor.","\"The navigator program is similar to Medicare counselors, which have existed for years and never faced this kind of bullying from Florida,\" said U.S. Health and Human Services Department spokesman Fabien Levy.","States receive federal grants to hire people that help Medicare beneficiaries enroll for coverage, and this year Florida received about $3 million.","The Florida version of the program is calledSHINE(Serving Health Insurance Needs of Elders) and is overseen by the Florida Department of Elder Affairs, which contracts with local Area Agency on Aging groups. Florida has 463 SHINE volunteers.","SHINE volunteers aren\u2019t involved in Obamacare and aren\u2019t called navigators, said Ashley Marshall, spokeswoman for the state Department of Elder Affairs.","But they fulfill a similar role in that they help guide Floridians who need insurance.","SHINE volunteers assist seniors primarily with questions about Medicare, and sometimes Medicaid if a client qualifies for both.Outreachefforts include a helpline and spreading the word at community events.","\"What we provide is free unbiased information,\" said Charles Franckle, SHINE coordinator for Pinellas County. \"When people are approaching Medicare they might contact us to ask us should they sign up for Part A and B and how do they do it.\"","SHINE volunteers don\u2019t endorse a particular plan. But they can answer questions about the differences between the various Medicare options by teaching the callers how to use theMedicare.govwebsite or doing it for them and sending them the results.","Paid employees provide Medicaid counseling through the state Agency for Health Care Administration or contracted vendors. The counselors assist recipients via phone, in writing or in person and conduct community outreach and education.","Florida KidCare insurance","Florida\u2019sKidCarehealth insurance program for poor children includes outreach to help families sign up for care. Anoutreach calendarfor September showed various community events statewide where families could learn more about KidCare, such as at Pasco County\u2019s Kids Health and Safety Day.","In fact, KidCare even uses the term \"navigators.\"","A Nelson spokesman pointed to a 2012 samplecontractthat stated the Florida Healthy Kids Corp. was seeking grant proposals from \"eligible organizations to become Regional Navigators and assist eligible families in applying for or retaining Florida KidCare.\"","Three entities signed that contract: Health Council of Southeast Florida, Broward County Health Department and United Way of Marion County, according to the Florida Healthy Kids Corp.","Legislative appropriations earmarked for Florida KidCare outreach were eliminated in July 2003, said Christie Goss, spokeswoman for Florida Healthy Kids Corp., a KidCare partner. Butcommunity groups statewidecontinue to promote KidCare and help the public enroll.","Florida Healthy Kids provides some grants for KidCare promotion -- about $900,000 since 2011-12.","The University of South Florida\u2019s Covering Kids and Families, which received an Obamacare navigator grant, has been doing outreach for enrollment for KidCare and Medicaid since 1999 with state, federal and foundation grants.","\"We work with schools, churches, hospitals, businesses, etc.,\" said program director Jodi Ray. \"We conduct our outreach and education activities wherever we have the best chance to reach people who need this information. We also have a military outreach project that specifically focuses on making sure that both active duty and veteran families get the information they need about getting their kids covered. The enrollment assistance is an important component of the outreach efforts.\"","The particular requirements and training for Obamacare navigators and those who assist Floridians with KidCare or Medicaid can vary. However, \"it\u2019s very similar in that we are helping people apply for health coverage,\" Ray said. \"We are not collecting medical health information -- we are simply helping them understand how to navigate the process without getting overwhelmed or confused and be able to answer questions so they can make decisions they need to make.\"","Veterans","The Florida Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits counseling related to state and federal veterans\u2019 programs. The department has paid claims examiners who work out of VA medical centers, clinics and nursing homes and provide benefits counseling to help connect Floridians to benefits such as disability payments and pensions.

They may not even poll the general election because they don\u2019t trust their methodology.\"","A lot of people wonder about the accuracy of the polls, and it would be a big deal if the pollsters themselves were just as skeptical. We decided to drill down on Deace\u2019s points that pollsters are warning people not to trust their data, and that Gallup stopped its primary polling because it doesn\u2019t trust its methodology.","A cluster of articles","Deace told us he relied on several stories that came out recently.Bloombergwrote about systematic flaws in the data. High on the list: -- the rise of cell phone-only households and a growing percentage of people who refuse to answer pollsters\u2019 questions.","The best public opinion operations employ banks of callers who are fed randomly picked phone numbers. Cell phones make it tougher to determine where the interviewee actually lives, which matters a lot for state-level polls. Plus, federal rules about calling cell phones mean you must hand-dial each one, rather than use a faster automated dialer. That\u2019s a significant cost factor.","And then there\u2019s the response rate. When more people hang up, that raises questions about whether the people who participate are unrepresentative of the public at large.","\"As response rates have declined, the need to rely on risky mathematical maneuvers has increased,\" the Bloomberg article said.","There was also a report fromPoliticothat carried awarning from pollsters. They said they shouldn\u2019t be the ones \"to winnow the GOP field.\"","\"Don\u2019t trust polls to detect often-tiny grades of opinion in a giant field,\" thePoliticowriter summarized.","The point was, news organizations sponsoring debates are counting on polls to decide who to bring on the stage and who to cut. With over a dozen Republican candidates, many of them clustered in the single-digits, the differences between any two are nearly certain to be smaller than the polls\u2019 well-published margin of error.","If just 1 percentage point separates Candidate A from Candidate B, and the margin of error is 3.5 percent, you have a problem.","But it\u2019s not a problem that stems from the polling itself. As thePoliticoarticle noted, it\u2019s a problem with how debate organizers are using the polls.","What\u2019s up with Gallup?","So those two articles are the grounds for the first part of Deace\u2019s statement. Then there was his comment about Gallup. The bombshell in the polling world, as these things go, was Gallup\u2019s decision to pull back from tracking the presidential primaries. This came out in anotherPoliticoarticle headlined, \"Gallup gives up the horse race.\"","\"After a bruising 2012 cycle, in which its polls were farther off than most of its competitors, Gallup toldPoliticoit isn't planning any polls for the presidential primary horse race this cycle,\"Politicowrote. \"And, even following an internal probe into what went wrong last time around, Gallup won't commit to tracking the general election next year.\"","Gallup is one of the granddaddies of polling and had done a lot of polls in past elections. It was no small thing for the primaries to lose such a prominent player.","Frank Newport, Gallup\u2019s editor-in-chief, toldPoliticothat the polling firm thought it could have more impact by asking people what they think about issues, rather than who they want to see in the White House.","While the article drew a connection between Gallup\u2019s move and its polling methods, Newport himself didn\u2019t say that. And afterward, he sent around a statement rebutting the story\u2019s broader implication.","\"Unlike some critics, we at Gallup remain very strong in our belief in the accuracy of polling today, even with the new challenges that are in front of the industry,\" Newport said. \"Our post-mortem work in 2012\/2013 and our experimentation in the 2014 midterms leave us with little doubt that polling, including our own, can be accurate in 2016.\"","Taking Newport\u2019s words at face value, worries about Gallup\u2019s methodology did not drive its decision.","Deace told us he had not seen Newport\u2019s statement.","Charles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and director of the Marquette University Law School Poll, told us he thinks this was more a business decision, but the picture is complicated. Gallup does a lot of contract work for businesses, and in that context, political polling comes with a risk.","\"You can be judged by how you do on the presidential vote in November,\" Franklin said. \"If you have troubles with that, it creates problems for the company.\"","Franklin said he thinks Gallup does as good a job as anybody, but he can see why the firm might decide it makes more sense to pull back from election tracking.","Polling in changing times","There\u2019s no question that it has become trickier and more expensive to be accurate. It\u2019s also clear that the better financed pollsters adapt. Statistics researchers Ole Forsberg and Mark Payton at Oklahoma State University focused on the cell phone issue. Forsberg told us the pollsters have come up with a variety of approaches. He said while we won\u2019t know which ones work best until this election is over, he\u2019s optimistic.","\"The current polling methods are most likely more accurate than in 2012,\" Forsberg said. \"They may be more accurate than in 2008. They are most likely worse than in 2004.\"","Polling in 2004 was more reliable because landlines were more common back then, and landlines are inherently easier to work with than cell phones.","As for the hurdle of rising refusal rates, Franklin said the survey firms, including his, spend more time getting full interviews.","\"We have to call many more numbers to get a big enough sample size, but there\u2019s plenty of evidence that we\u2019re reaching enough,\" he said.","Historical trends collected by theNational Council on Public Polls, a trade association of pollsters, track the gap between polling and actual voting results in presidential years. In 2012, the average error was 1.46 percentage points. That was slightly higher than in the previous three elections in 2008, 2004 and 2000, but less than the error in 1996 when it was 2.1 percentage points.","Jon Krosnick at Stanford University has assessed polls for many years. Krosnick distinguishes between polling organizations that dot their I\u2019s and cross their T\u2019s, and those that don\u2019t.","\"Our evaluations of survey accuracy indicate that surveys done using best practices, which is expensive, continue to be remarkably accurate,\" Krosnick said. \"If you look at the average of the final pre-election polls done by the neutral news organizations that used high quality methods just before the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, they predicted the national popular vote within one percentage point.\"","Krosnick said the danger lies in the proliferation of firms that do polling on the cheap. Those results, he said, could give the impression that polling in general is less accurate.","All that said, Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers University political scientist and former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, warns that no one should underestimate the challenges polling faces today. Zukin said there\u2019s a huge issue of figuring out who will actually vote and all the problems only get worse at the state level where much of the attention is focused during the primaries.","\"We are less sure how to conduct good survey research now than we were four years ago, and much less than eight years ago,\" Zukin wrote in anop-ed.","A particularly subtle form of error seems to have crept into the picture. Nate Silver, a statistician who grew famous for his accurate election predictions and is now editor-in-chief of 538.com, has written about the \"herding\" phenomenon. That\u2019s when polling firms fear to publish results that don\u2019t track with other polls.","\"Pollsters have admitted to suppressing polls they deem to be outliers but that would have turned out to be just right,\" Silverwrote in 538. \"In the U.S. last year, at least two polling firms declined to publish surveys showing a tight Senate race in Virginia, which in the end was decided by only 18,000 votes in what was almost a historic upset.\"","Early polls in a class by themselves","From what we found, most research into polling accuracy looks at surveys done in the final weeks of a campaign. Right now, we are nearly four months before the first ballot is cast in Iowa. Deace said he thinks the polls are a joke because he doesn\u2019t think they reflect who will carry the caucuses.","Franklin at Marquette University told us for pollsters, that\u2019s the wrong question.","\"This is very much like midway through the second quarter of a football game,\" he said. \"It is not telling you with great certainty who will win the game. But it is telling you who's playing well and who isn't. And we still have the second half to play.\"","Franklin said, if you don\u2019t think the score at halftime tells the whole story, you shouldn\u2019t expect any more from polls at this stage of the primary process.","Our ruling"]}

And the health plan \u2014 pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and backed as well by Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 leaves many details yet to be colored in.","We were curious where these figures came from, and how they could be derived. So we decided to dig in.","We contacted the Biden campaign, which told us the figure was derived from approximating the impact of a 4% income tax, plus a 7.5% payroll tax \u2014 financing mechanisms they said have been proposed by Sanders.","When you do the math, that suggests a family making $60,000 would indeed see the tax increase Biden surmised.","But this math is problematic on many levels.","For one thing, Sanders\u2019 bill doesn\u2019t actually propose financing Medicare for All through a combined 4% income tax and 7.5% payroll tax. The bill doesn\u2019t include any financing mechanism at all.","In a separate document, Sanders talks about different ways to pay for the system \u2014 and those are listed as two examples of pay-fors. But they aren\u2019t the only ones, and Sanders frames this list as \"a number of options to begin [the] discussion.\"","So suggesting that Medicare for All would increase taxes as specifically as Biden suggests is an inaccurate reflection of the bill.","Another issue is that there isn\u2019t a good sense of what this health plan would cost, so any estimate of its tax burden is really just a guess.","\"There are so many unknowns that you cannot say anything definitive,\" said Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University.","Biden\u2019s statement \"could be true,\" he added \u2014 but \"there\u2019s no evidence either way.\"","And there\u2019s another issue, said Ellen Meara, a health economist at Dartmouth College. That is, highlighting the potential tax burden of Medicare for All without discussing overall costs is misleading, she argued.","Meara pointed to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which found that the average employer-sponsored plan for a family of four costs $20,000 per in premiums. That, economists say, results in lower wages for employees. Many argue that if employers were relieved of this cost, that would translate into people earning significantly more in take-home pay.","\"A $5,000 or $6,000 tax is really quite small compared with what middle-class families forego in cash wages to get employer-sponsored coverage,\" Meara said."]}

(It has been studied for some time, but hasn\u2019t been used in a vaccine until now.) The mRNA is fragile and needs to be handled carefully, with specific temperatures and humidity levels to keep it from breaking down.","It\u2019s highly unlikely, experts say, that \"dozens\" of manufacturing plants have the capability to get this type of production off the ground immediately. Even if Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna made their vaccine designs open source today, pharmaceutical researchers estimate that it would still take several months for other companies to produce the shots, and by then mass distribution and inoculation will be well underway.","PolitiFact reached out to both companies for comment but did not hear back.","Dr. Rajeev Venkayya \u2014 president of the Global Vaccine Business Unit at Takeda Pharmaceuticals and former director of vaccine delivery at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s Global Health Program \u2014wrote a Twitter threadaddressing the complexity and risk of vaccine manufacturing.","Among many issues, Venyakka said that vaccines are complex biologics and it\u2019s hard to predict whether changes to the manufacturing process will impact vaccine efficacy or safety.","\"Many vaccines are made by growing viruses in cells, and when that doesn\u2019t happen as expected, it can lead to losses in production and delayed timelines. This is an area where cell- and virus-free mRNA vaccine production has a major advantage,\"Venkayya wrote.","\"For these reasons, every aspect of vaccine manufacturing is tightly controlled: raw materials, equipment, production processes, training, operating procedures etc. All of it happens under GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) regulations, and facilities are regularly inspected.\"","THREAD: Vaccine ManufacturingBack in October, I said the Warp Speed timelines were extraordinarily optimistic given the inherent risks of vaccine development, manufacturing and distribution. All of those risks and others have materialized. 1\/https:\/\/t.co\/OOlGxPBnoxpic.twitter.com\/RwCzkljdDS","According to the Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers may share any information or data about their products as they choose, as they are the owners of the information. But the firm is responsible for ensuring that any contract manufacturer is in compliance with the FDA\u2019sgood manufacturing practiceregulations.","These rules establish minimum requirements for the methods, facilities and controls used in making and packing pharmaceuticals. They aim to ensure that a product is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have.","John Grabenstein, associate director for scientific communications at theImmunization Action Coalition\u2014 a vaccine information organization that works in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014  told PolitiFact the tweet wrongly presumes that the companies aren\u2019t already outsourcing production. Grabenstein tracks the partnerships between pharmaceutical firms and contract manufacturers.","He said that Pfizer-BioNTech is currently working with bio-pharmaceutical companiesRentschlerandPolymun, while Moderna has partnered withRovi,RecipharmandLonza.Some of the companies are located entirely overseas, while others have plants in the U.S.","Typically, the contractors are doing one of the major portions of production, Grabenstein said, such as manufacturing the bulk product, formulation of the bulk into the final preparation, filling the drug product into vials, or finishing the final packaging which could include labeling vials, inserting them and paperwork into boxes and assembling boxes for a carton.","For example, Rovi, one of the companies working with Moderna,signed a contractin July 2020 to start filling and packaging 100 million doses of the vaccine in early 2021.","In fewer cases, a full-fledged manufacturer is commissioned to make a mirror image of the original product, from start to finish.","One example of this is the Serum Institute of India \u2014 the world\u2019slargest vaccine manufacturer\u2014 which is already producing a parallel version of theOxford\/AstraZeneca vaccinethat the institute will market with the trade name CoviShield. The institute launched construction of new facilities back in June 2020 to make it happen. The organization recently announced a similar partnership withNovavax.","\"This is incredibly intricate and the number of facilities and trained personnel is really, really small,\" Grabenstein said. \"It\u2019s not like you\u2019re just giving a recipe to another restaurant. That \u2018recipe\u2019 is thousands and thousands of pages long, and then you have to validate and show that you meet all the really tight performance specifications and prove consistency of process before any of the regulators will let you distribute any of the vaccine.\"","Hamblin, the author of the Twitter post, said it\u2019s unlikely that the companies would share their vaccine designs, given the current system of intellectual property and funding, though he noted exceptions, like Sanofi.","Sanofi, a French multinational pharmaceutical company,announced in Januarythat it entered into a partnership with BioNTech, the firm that co-developed the vaccine with Pfizer. Sanofi said it will provide the firm access to its \"established infrastructure and expertise to produce over 125 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in Europe.\" Initial supplies will originate from Sanofi\u2019s production facilities in Frankfurt from summer of 2021.","Hamblin noted that if vaccine makers open the intellectual property in a permanent, unconditional way \u2014 rather than on a small scale for a finite period \u2014 it could help get more companies and governments into the production \"in a more permanent, cost-effective way.\"","\"If we have to manufacture boosters in specific areas for new strains, for example, or for the next coronavirus, we could be on it right away,\" Hamblin said. \"Again, speaking hypothetically about that \u2014 not implying it will happen or would be quick or easy or anything else.\"","With President Joe Bideninvoking the Defense Production Act, couldn\u2019t that serve to help speed things up? Yes, but it\u2019s not as sweeping as some think.","The Defense Production Act of 1950gives presidential authority to promote national defense by expediting and expanding the supply of materials and services from the U.S. industrial base.","George Siber, a vaccine expert who is on the advisory board of CureVac, a German mRNA vaccine company,told Kaiser Health Newsthat invoking the act would allow the government to commandeer an appropriate plant to expand production, but said it would still take about a year to get going.","Companies would first have to undertake a thorough cleaning of their equipment and facilities to prevent cross-contamination and would need to set up, calibrate and test equipment, and train scientists and engineers to run it,Siber told KHN.","\"Do you want glass? Aluminum? Filter resins? What is the thing that you need?\" Grabenstein said. \"For example, vaccine manufacturers say, \u2018if only I had more glass vials, I could increase my weekly production.\u2019 Ok, the government gets you more glass vials. Then it reveals the next bottleneck.\"","He added: \"Is there production that could be stopped or delayed, and let those machines be used for this goal? Sure, but you still have to clean it, and quality control that it\u2019s really clean, and then the transfer and validation of process. It\u2019s months or years of commitment. This is not turn-on-a-dime kind of stuff.\"","According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than59 million dosesof the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines had been distributed and roughly 41 million administered by the second week in February.","This shows that the U.S. has vaccinated 9.5% of the population, putting it about fifth in the world,according to a tracker maintained by The New York Times."]}

(It was actually atop-of-the-head riffby Stein, a trained economist.)","Here\u2019s the part that\u2019s relevant to our fact-check (watch ithere):","\"In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression.\"","Stein\u2019s monologue pretty much tracks with what Sasse said: The United States imposed tariffs, they backfired, and the Depression got worse.","Specifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 \u2014 sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. \u2014 raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. It was signed on June 17, 1930, or seven and a half months after Wall Street\u2019s \"Black Tuesday\" on Oct. 29, 1929.","The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, in turn, led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own.","Several economists and historians who studied the period told us the Stein-Sasse version of events is quite accurate.","Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author ofPeddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawleyand the Great DepressionandTrade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s, said there was \"no real reason\" to impose the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, and that it was mainly done for \"domestic political reasons.\" In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly and over the spirited objections of many economists.","\"Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression,\" Irwin said, but he added that it\u2019s fair to say it made the depression \"longer and more painful.\"","After the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports.","\"Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump,\" Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that \"if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country's imports are another country's exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time.\"","Indeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That\u2019s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office.","As a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies\u2019 efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan.","This isn\u2019t to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot-Hawley in worsening the Great Depression.","\"Economists today debate the tariffs\u2019 effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small,\" said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author ofContraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century.","For instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author ofThe Great Depression: America 1929-1941, said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade.","Still, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren\u2019t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression, the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative. It\u2019s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said.","\"It's entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism,\" said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author ofGlobal Great Depression and the Coming of World War II. \"However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression.\""]}

Therefore, all these questions are, at bottom, about when you are authorized to use deadly force against another person,\" said Frank Bowman III of the University of Missouri.","Using force is generally permissible to defend yourself from another person\u2019s wrongful use of force against you, but it has to be proportionate, said Fordham University law professor Nicholas Johnson and University of Pennsylvania law professor Kermit Roosevelt.","\"In particular, deadly force is not allowed unless it\u2019s a response to a threat of death or great bodily harm. Hitting someone with a car is deadly force. So, the question would be at what point would a motorist reasonably believe they were threatened with death or serious injury.

Rand Paul of Kentucky stood out a bitwhen he citedAmerica\u2019s second president.","It came during a heated exchange with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about how much government intrusiveness was needed to keep Americans safe from terrorism.","\"I want to collect more records from terrorists, but less records from innocent Americans,\" said Paul, who has been a leading voice in his party for privacy from government intrusion. \"The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the Revolution over. John Adams said it was the spark that led to our war for independence, and I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights, and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights.\"","Taken in its most literal interpretation, this claim doesn\u2019t make much sense, since the Fourth Amendment was ratified in 1791, about a decade and a half after the American Revolution began. But it\u2019s pretty clear that Paul means that the issues embedded in the Fourth Amendment were a factor in the revolution, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re checking.","Did Adams say the Fourth Amendment was \"the spark that led to our war for independence?\"","For those who have forgotten what they learned in high-school civics class, the Fourth Amendmentreads as follows:","\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"","From looking at the documents and checking with experts, it appears that Paul is basically correct in saying that Adams felt this way, though the second president never actually used the word \"spark\" himself.","This goes back to the use of \"writs of assistance\" or general standing warrants that gave British law enforcement officials in Massachusetts -- Adams\u2019 home state -- wide powers to inspect the property and possessions of colonists in order to root out the proceeds of smuggling. These warrants were long-lasting -- up to six months after the death of the issuing sovereign -- and they permitted officials to enter any house during the day. They did not require officials to obtain a more specific permission from a judge -- what would today be called a search warrant.","Not surprisingly, many colonists saw these broad governmental powers as onerous. The issue came to a head in 1761, when a Boston lawyer,James Otis Jr., led a group seeking redress from the court. Otis and his fellow complainants lost the case, but their arguments made a deep impression on Adams, then a 25-year-old lawyer who was in the courtroom when the case was heard.","Two documents show the significance of this case in Adams\u2019 mind. One wasa letterto his wife, Abigail, on July 3, 1776 -- 15 years later, and the day before the signing of the Declaration of Independence:","\"When I look back to the Year 1761, and recollect the Argument concerning Writs of Assistance, in the Superiour Court, which I have hitherto considered as the Commencement of the Controversy, between Great Britain and America, and run through the whole Period from that Time to this, and recollect the series of political Events, the Chain of Causes and Effects, I am surprized at the Suddenness, as well as Greatness of this Revolution.\"","Thesecond documentwas a letter Adams wrote to his former student, William Tudor, in 1817, more than half a century after the court arguments. Tudor was assembling Otis\u2019 papers posthumously.","\"Every Man of an immense crouded Audience appeared to me to go away, as I did, ready to take Arms against Writs of Assistants. Then and there was the first scene of the first Act of opposition to the Arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the Child Independence was born. In fifteen years i.e. in 1776. he grew up to Manhood, & declared himself free.\"","While some sources imply that Adams himself used the term \"spark,\"such asa Heritage Foundation guide to the Constitution, it was actually his grandson, Charles Francis Adams, who did.","In 1856, Adams\u2019 grandson published abiographyof the second president.

Other key factors certainly include the British Empire trying to control white settlers from taking native Indian land, political arguments over economic regulations, and eventually a rising series of provocations and complaints on both sides.\"","The best place to look for a list of causes of the revolution is theDeclaration of Independence, added Brian Murphy, an early-American historian at Baruch College of the City University of New York. These include the king\u2019s refusal to acknowledge representative government, his close control of the judiciary, the forced quartering of British soldiers, the imposition of taxes without consent, and the provoking of Indian insurrections against the colonists, among many others cited in the founding document.","\"The British lost the colonies through some very stupid, unforced errors, and (search and seizure) is one of those things,\" Murphy said.","When we contacted Paul\u2019s campaign, spokeswoman Eleanor May said that Paul didn\u2019t claim that the Fourth Amendment was the only cause of the American Revolution.","\"Sen. Paul stands by his statement, though he encourages every American to read the work of John Adams and our other Founding Fathers and draw their own conclusions,\" May said.","Our ruling"]}

Interestingly, Lee\u2019s father-in-law specified in his will that all the family\u2019s slaves be freed within five years of his death.","Sean Kane, the American Civil War Museum\u2019s former interpretation and programs specialist,wrote in an articlethat Lee, as executor of the will, \"drove his new-found labor force hard to lift those estates from debt,\" and, concerned it would take longer than five years, \"petitioned state courts to extend his control of enslaved people.\" That didn\u2019t happen, as Leefreedthem in accordance with the will in 1862 (and three days before the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect).","While his actions and slave-owning practices suggest he supported slavery, some of Lee\u2019s writings offer a more muddled view.","Prior to the Civil War, on Dec. 27, 1856, Leewrote to his wife: \"In this enlightened age, there are few I believe, but what will acknowledge, that slavery as an institution, is a moral & political evil in any Country. It is useless to expatiate on its disadvantages.\"","But he goes on to say that slavery was \"a greater evil to the white man than to the black race\" and \"while my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more strong for the former.\" Lee wrote that African Americans were \"immeasurably better off\" in the U.S. than in Africa and that the \"painful discipline they are undergoing, is necessary for their instruction as a race.\"","Eric Foner, a Civil War historian and Columbia University professor, referred us toa passage he wroteon Lee\u2019s connection with slavery in the New York Times Book Review:","\"During his lifetime, Lee owned a small number of slaves. He considered himself a paternalistic master but could also impose severe punishments, especially on those who attempted to run away. Lee said almost nothing in public about the institution. His most extended comment, quoted by all biographers, came in a letter to his wife in 1856. Here he described slavery as an evil, but one that had more deleterious effects on whites than blacks. He felt that the \u2018painful discipline\u2019 to which they were subjected benefitted blacks by elevating them from barbarism to civilization and introducing them to Christianity. The end of slavery would come in God's good time, but this might take quite a while, since to God a thousand years was just a moment. Meanwhile, the greatest danger to the \u2018liberty\u2019 of white southerners was the \u2018evil course\u2019 pursued by the abolitionists, who stirred up sectional hatred. In 1860, Lee voted for John C. Breckenridge, the extreme proslavery candidate (a more moderate southerner, John Bell, carried Virginia that year).\"","\"I would not say that this qualifies Lee as \u2018against slavery,\u2019\" Foner added in the email.","John Reeves, author of \"The Lost Indictment of Robert E. Lee\"wrote a poston some of the most popular myths attributed to the general \u2014 the first being Lee\u2019s opposition to slavery.","Reeves explains that after losing the war, Lee attempted to present himself as always being against slavery. In an interview after his surrender, Reeves says, Lee said that \"the best men of the South\" were eager to do away with it, and in a testimony in 1866 he had \"always been in favor of emancipation \u2014 gradual emancipation.\"","But Reeves writes that the historical record doesn\u2019t support these statements, as Lee and his family owned and managed slaves for decades and benefited \"tremendously\" from the institution."]}

Still, some states in the intervening years tried to pass laws that mandated the death penalty.","In 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court found all such laws unconstitutional, the \"last vestiges of the mandatory death penalty in the United States,\" theNew York Timesexplained.","In addition to pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Bracy\u2019s legislative assistant Travaris McCurdy also pointed to Florida cases including an argument byAttorney General Pam Bondiin a death penalty appeal case,State vs. Perry.

Scott has not said that prosecutors must seek death sentences,\" Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said. \"State Attorney Aramis Ayala was removed from the cases in the interest of justice following her public announcement to not consider capital punishment during her time in office, regardless of the individual facts and circumstances in any case.\"","On April 3, Scott removed Ayala, a Democrat, from 21 additional first-degree murder cases and reassigned them to Brad King, a Republican Ocala-based state attorney.","Our ruling"]}

But after the amendment passed, he said there was a wave of states that passed laws or amendments to take away prisoners\u2019 right to vote.","He said the fact that 48 states still don\u2019t allow incarcerated people to vote is unquestionably a relic of Jim Crow-era laws. But, Morales-Doyle said, after Florida\u2019s 2018 vote to enfranchise felons who have completed their sentences, there has been an increased interest in efforts to return voting rights to people across the criminal justice system.","In Vermont, though, even having total enfranchisement for prisoners still leaves a narrower field of voters than there once was. Peter Teachout, a professor at Vermont Law School, said from 1777 to 1824, the state was \"so hungry for voters\" that even non-U.S. citizens had the right to vote in Vermont. (Vermont\u2019s capital city voted last year to allow non-citizens to vote once again, a charter changenow being debated in the state Legislature.)","The question that cannot be answered is whether Vermont\u2019s prisoners actually employed their Constitutional rights throughout history. Condos said the state doesn\u2019t track how many incarcerated Vermonters vote. Rather, they appear on the voter checklist in the same manner as all other voters. Condos said there\u2019s very little evidence to suggest inmates in Vermont institutions were historically able to exercise that right.","\"That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not the case, only that we have yet to find any evidence of it,\" Condos said. \"Voting is the bedrock of our democracy, and we have worked hard to ensure that we\u2019re breaking down barriers for eligible voters to register and cast their ballots.\""]}

Bruce Rauner has done since first becoming a candidate in 2013, Pritzker and Kennedy released their federal and state 1040 forms, which reveal only basic details of their their tax pictures. The meat of returns, especially for wealthy taxpayers like Pritzker, Kennedy and Rauner, lies in an array of schedules and attachments to those 1040s that illustrate how they made their money, managed their wealth, donated to charity and reduced their tax burdens by leveraging breaks often used by the wealthy. And neither Pritzker, Kennedy nor Rauner have been willing to share such telling information with voters.","\"These guys are now pretty much living up to the @BruceRauner standard.

They showed Biss and his wife, Karin Steinbrueck, with quite modest income, averaging just under $55,000 per year over the five years covered in the returns. Biss spent more than seven months criticizing his wealthy competitors for foot-dragging before they released their returns.","With nominating petitions now filed for the March 20 Democratic primary and election season in full swing, the Rauner and Romney comparisons likely will become a hammer with which Biss will repeatedly bash his far wealthier opponents. We decided to look into Biss\u2019 Twitter claim both to check its accuracy and to examine the history of candidate tax disclosure.","The \"Bruce Rauner standard\" that Biss, currently a state senator, cites refers to the tax disclosures Rauner has made annually since he first became a candidate for governor in 2013. Though Illinois law does not require candidates or officeholders to make public any income tax information, Raunerreleased three years\u2019 worthof federal and state 1040 forms when he filed his nominating petitions in November 2013. They showed Rauner and his wife Diana had income of $27.2 million in 2010, $28.2 million in 2011 and $53.4 million in 2012. Their effective tax rates in those years were 16.9 percent, 21.5 percent and 19 percent, respectively.","Rauner has continued to release the 1040 forms since then. His 2013 returns, released a month before the 2014 election, showed income of $60.15 million and a 24-percent tax rate. In 2014, the Rauners reported income of$57.5 millionand a 26-percent tax rate.","Rauner\u2019s income ballooned during his first two years as governor. In 2015, hereported incomeof $188 million followed by$91 millionin 2016, with tax rates of 26 and 25, respectively.","But because Rauner has not released the schedules and attachments that detail how his income was derived, the 1040 forms lend little insight where his money comes from and how he manages it.","Pritzker essentially matched Rauner\u2019s skimpy disclosure when the Democrat filed his nominating petitions on Nov. 27, but Kennedy did even less. Pritzker releasedsummaries of his last three years of taxesshowing adjusted gross income of $14,950,446 in 2016, $9,974,627 in 2015 and $3,137,655 in 2014. His effective tax rates were 27.7 percent (2016), 24.3 percent (2015) and 37.3 percent (2014).","Kennedy confined his release of 1040 information to 2016 returns only. For that year, he reported adjusted gross income $1,242,805 and an effective tax rate of 14 percent.","The financial picture for Kennedy and Pritzker, at least, is further obscured by their decisions to not release detail about trusts they also benefit from but which are kept separate from the information reported on their personal tax returns.","Like Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy derived their income from interest, dividends and capital gains, not from wages.","Candidates in Illinois are are also required to filestatements of economic interestthat detail entities in which they have ownership interests or derive income, and all the Democrats as well as Rauner have complied. But the information value from such reports is quite limited, with disclosures confined to the names of business interests and not the value of individual investments or income they produce. (Click here for current statements of economic interest fromRauner,PritzkerandKennedy.)","Biss also accuses his Democratic counterparts of \"falling dismally short\" of the example set by 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, like Rauner a longtime private equity investor whose wealth had become an issue in his unsuccessful attempt to unseat then-President Barack Obama. Romney released complete income taxes for2010and2011, including hundreds of pages of schedules and explanatory material that allowed a public view into the management of his fortune.","They showedRomney paid a relatively low tax rate of 14.7 percent on a total of $42.6 million in income for the two years combined, and that he held considerable assets in offshore tax havens including Luxembourg, Ireland and the Cayman Islands. In an election in which income inequality had become a major issue, this gave Obama\u2019s campaign ammunition to portray the former Massachusetts governor as out of touch with the vast majority of Americans.","Romney was following what had become standard procedure for presidents and major presidential candidates of both parties following the scandal plagued administration of Richard Nixon, said Joseph Thorndike, director of theTax History Project, which tracks presidential tax releases. Obama also routinely released full returns annually both as a presidential contender and president.","Obama\u2019s successor, Donald Trump, is the first U.S. president since Nixon, who resigned from office in 1974, to not release any information about personal taxes.","A proliferation of wealthy political candidates coming off successful business careers in Illinois and elsewhere likely portends an era of increasing opaqueness when it comes to tax disclosure, Thorndike speculated.","\"I don't know that 1040s are really all that useful without the rest of the supporting materials,\" Thorndike said. \"I suppose that they're better than nothing, except that I think you encourage further disclosures of just the 1040s.\"","Governors\u2019 roles in administering state taxes should heighten public pressure to release full returns, Thorndike said.","\"These candidates if they win election are going to be in charge of collecting taxes from everyone else and it seems reasonable to me that voters want to know how they conducted themselves and whether they've been living up to their civic duty in the way that everyone else is supposed to,\" he said.","Lawrence Noble, senior director the D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center, said the current push in Washington for a sweeping federal overhaul, only underscores the shortcomings of the sort of limited tax disclosure practiced by Rauner, Pritzker and Kennedy.","All derive the bulk of their income from investments, and are likely to reap significant financial benefit from the current GOP push in Washington to overhaul the federal tax system that most analysts have concluded is tilted toward tax breaks for the wealthy. How much any of the well-to-do Illinois candidates stand to benefit is impossible to gauge without more information than is disclosed in 1040 forms.","\"Where they have their investments, how much they have and how various pieces of legislation will affect them is important,\" said Noble, a former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission. \"And one of the ways you can tell that is by their taxes and often it's the only way you can tell unless you\u2019re just going to take their word for it.\""]}

But this decision has raised questions about school funding, which in Texas is tied to attendance.","A post shared to the Facebook page of a Dallas-area elementary school said that school districts will lose out on state funding if they do not open their doors for in-person learning this fall.","\"(The Texas Education Agency) is allowing online learning with attendance stipulations but will not fund school districts if they do not open their schools,\" reads the post from Wilmer Hutchins Elementary School. \"If schools do not open and are not funded there will be no more teachers or school at all.\"","The post was removed from the school\u2019s Facebook page after PolitiFact Texas reached out to learn more information, but the question remains: What do the state guidelines have to say about schools opening their doors and how does that relate to school funding?","While schools do risk losing state funding if they do not open their doors when the state requires them to do so, it is inaccurate to suggest that all schools that do not open on the state\u2019s timeline will shut down entirely.","Examining school funding in Texas","Student attendance is a key part of how Texas funds its public schools.","With the exception of charter schools, public school districts are funded through a combination of local property taxes and state money, according to Emily Sass, policy director at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation.","Sass said the state guarantees a certain amount of money per student to each district every year. Depending on how much the district\u2019s local property taxes cover, the state contributes additional funds to ensure each district has a certain amount of funding per child.","The number of students that are factored into this calculation comes from average daily attendance for that year, which each district reports to the state. Schools also receive a minor funding allotment per day for students who need extra support, including low-income students and students with disabilities.","This means schools with lower attendance rates receive less state funding.","What the reopening guidelines say","When the coronavirus hit Texas in March, public schools in the state started to close. By mid-April, Gov. Greg Abbott said students would complete the remainder of the spring semester online.","Infections, hospitalizations and fatalities started to increase in June, putting the status of the fall school semester in question.","The state education agency released its first set of guidelines for the fall semester in early July, detailing requirements for districts in response to the pandemic. The TEA released its most recently updated guidelines on July 17 after pushback from some parents and school districts.","The original guidelines as well as the revised guidelines say that public schools must open classrooms for any family wanting a student to learn in person to keep all state funding, even in places where the bulk of learning is happening online.","Under the guidelines, if every family at one school opted for online learning this fall, the school would still receive state funding \u2014 even if the building is not physically open. But if even one family at a school wants a child to receive in-person instruction, that request must be accommodated in order for the school to maintain its state funding. TEA officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment about how much state funding would be affected if a school does not follow these guidelines.","The original guidelines released by TEA said this rule does not apply during the first three weeks of school, when districts have the option to limit in-person instruction. The second guidelines, which were released well after the Facebook post was made and deleted, said schools could remain virtual for four weeks with the option of extending to eight weeks with a vote from their local school board. Even with this delay, schools are required to provide on-campus instruction for students who do not have access to broadband internet or computers at home to complete their learning virtually.","Local health officials can also order schools to keep their buildings closed without the risk of losing state education funding, according to The Texas Tribune.","The latest guidelines also say that the state will not reduce funding to a school that is following the guidelines due to lack of attendance for the first 12 weeks of the school year. Instead, schools that are following the guidelines but struggling to maintain attendance numbers will receive funding based on either a three-year average attendance or an attendance projection.","There are two formats that virtual learning can take that still count toward student attendance: virtual class with teachers in real time (called synchronous learning) or a pre-approved plan involving tasks completed on a student\u2019s own time (called asynchronous learning). Schools have the option to use either format or a combination for students learning virtually.","For students opting to learn in real-time over apps like Zoom, teachers must teach for a certain number of minutes in order for it to count as a full day of school for attendance purposes. The number of minutes depends on the students\u2019 age, and this style of learning is limited to students in third grade and above.","For students learning on their own time, attendance will be based on an approved learning plan and will be measured through daily progress such as check-ins with teachers or the completion of assignments. This is the only virtual option available for students in prekindergarten through second grade, who the state decided are too young to participate in a synchronous learning program.","For schools that offer both kinds of virtual learning, students can be considered present for the day for participating in either type of online learning or a combination.","It is not clear yet how many families might choose remote learning versus in-person learning for the fall, and schools may opt to ask parents to commit to one option or the other ahead of the start of classes. Schools can also require that families that select online learning stick with that option for the rest of the grading period, which is usually six to nine weeks.","The TEA guidelines acknowledge that some schools may need to pause in-person classes \"due to positive COVID-19 cases in schools.\" Schools without remote learning options available that are ordered to close under these circumstances will not receive funding for the closed days, unless those days are made up later.","The Facebook post also claims that if schools do not open they will essentially close completely. There has been nothing in TEA guidelines or other communications that has suggested that schools that lose funding will stop operating. Rather, without state funding, districts would most likely have to reduce staff and cut certain programs, according to Clay Robison of the Texas State Teachers Association.","\"Some districts are in worse shape than other districts. There are some districts out there who will hurt worse than others but it\u2019s going to hurt everyone,\" he said. \"If they enact that penalty to cut off even part of state funding it\u2019s going to hurt districts and they are going to have to make some cuts.\"","Our ruling"]}

Eleven of those 13 speeches were at least eight years after he left the presidency while his wife was secretary of state.\"","Schweizer responded, noting that Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking fees \"dramatically\" went up when Hillary Clinton, now a presidential candidate, took office in 2009.","\"When you have one or two examples, it's a coincidence,\" he said. \"When you have this many, to me it's a trend.\"","We aren\u2019t going to dig into the truthfulness of Schweizer\u2019s overall thesis here. But we are interested in Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking fees while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department. His book says,\"Of the 13 Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state,\"according totheNew York Times, which has an advance copy.","By the millions","In 2014, beforeClinton Cashwas in the public eye, theWashington PostanalyzedClinton\u2019s speaking fees and found he made at least $104 million in speaking fees between 2001 through 2012 -- more than half of that income came from speeches in foreign countries (though he gave more speeches within the United States).","To find out more about Clinton\u2019s speaking fees, we turned to Hillary Clinton\u2019sfederal financial disclosure forms, made available by the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in politics. Because Hillary Clinton held federal positions from the time they left the White House in 2001 through 2012, her financial information as well as Bill Clinton\u2019s is available for all those years.","Schweizer didn\u2019t respond to our requests for comment, but income information on the financial disclosure forms supports his claim.","Here\u2019s a list of all the speeches for which Clinton received a fee of $500,000 or higher, including the year, location, host and actual fee:","2003-- Japan, $500,000Sakura Asset Management (Japanese finance corporation) (A note: This speech was canceled, but the fee went to Clinton\u2019s presidential library foundation);","2008-- California, $500,000, Power Within(life coach Anthony Robbins\u2019 brand);","2010-- Russia, $500,000, Renaissance Capital(Russian finance corporation);","2010-- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Novo Nordisk(Danish pharmaceutical company);","2011-- Nigeria,$700,000, THISDAY(newspaper);","2011-- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation(Austrian nongovernmental organization);","2011-- Netherlands, $600,000, Achmea(Dutch finance corporation);","2011-- China, $550,000, Huatuo CEO Forum(business conference);","2011-- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative(international environmental information organization);","2011-- Hong Kong, $750,000, Ericsson(Swedish multinational communications technology company);","2012-- Nigeria,$700,000, THISDAY(newspaper);","2012-- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation(Austrian nongovernmental organization);","2012-- Italy, $500,000, Technogym(fitness equipment manufacturer).","So in the time Clinton left the White House in January 2001 and when his wife stepped down from secretary of state in February 2013, Clinton indeed gave 13 speeches for which he made more than $500,000. Eleven of those occurred since January 2009, when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. Only two happened before then.","Schweizer suggests that Clinton\u2019s speaking fees went up in 2009 in part because companies wanted leverage within Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department.","For example,New York Timesreporters -- building off of Schweizer\u2019s work --foundthat while the State Department was involved in securing a uranium mining deal with Russia, investors in the company involved in the deal, Uranium One, gave millions to the Clinton Foundation.","Additionally, \"shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.\"","The article\u2019s talking about speech No. 3 on the list above, the 2010 speech paid for by Renaissance Capital.","ABC Newsalso examined Clinton\u2019s speaking records and found many instances in which he took in money from groups with pending interests at the State Department. State Department ethics officials had to sign off on these speaking engagements, but rarely did they say Clinton could not accept payment for a particular speech.","Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign has staunchly denied the implication that there was some sort of quid pro quo for entities that contributed to the Clintons\u2019 wealth, arguing that Schweizer\u2019s book does not have firm evidence of any such deal making.","Our ruling"]}

According to Anch\u00eda, the bill suffered two weaknesses: it had no protections against people using false IDs, and it allowed vote-by-mail to continue without proof of identification.","\"Vote by mail, that we know, is the greatest source of voter fraud in this state. In fact, all of the prosecutions by the attorney general \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t say all, but a great majority of the prosecutions by the attorney general occur with respect to vote by mail,\" Anch\u00eda said in 2007.","Cain posted the clip to his Facebook and Twitter pages July 22. Roy cited it in the congressional hearing one week later.","\"Remember when TX State Rep. @RafaelAnchia admitted that vote-by-mail was \u2018the greatest source of election fraud\u2019 in Texas,\" Cain tweeted. \"Now he\u2019s in DC pretending that election fraud is a myth.\"","Anch\u00eda\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to interview requests, so we turned to his Democratic colleague and ally, state Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston \u2014 whoremained in Texasfor medical reasons while his fellow Democrats flew to D.C. \u2014 to get a sense of what Anch\u00eda was basing his claim on.","\"Maybe he didn\u2019t know what he thought he knew,\" Coleman said. \"He may be overstating this idea that there was a lot of mail-in ballot fraud.\"","Election fraud data obtained from the Texas attorney general\u2019s office through a request under the Texas Public Information Act affirms Anch\u00eda\u2019s 2007 statement that mail-in ballot fraud was the greatest source of voter fraud in the state. But the data also shows that voter fraud cases are exceedingly rare, both in 2007 and in the years since.","For elections between 2004 and 2007, the attorney general\u2019s office convicted 33 people of 163 voter fraud charges out of the tens of millions of ballots cast in the primary and general elections during those years. About 140 of those charges, or 85%, involved mail-in voter fraud.","The proportion of mail-in ballot fraud among all voter fraud offenses through 2020 has decreased since then. According to the data, 58% of the 534 charges stemming from elections since 2004 involved mail-in voter fraud.","\"If we can agree that this is the greatest source of fraud \u2014 as Anch\u00eda did, then it's reckless to expand it in ways that make it harder to detect. If we do that, we only create further distrust in elections,\" Roy told PolitiFact. \"If a store owner who says, \u2018We never sell alcohol to minors\u2019 never checks IDs, how much faith can we put in that statement?\"","The cases the attorney general\u2019s office has prosecuted are the result of ongoing crackdowns on voter fraud over the last 15 years \u2014 during the tenure of Gov. Greg Abbott as attorney general and current Attorney General Ken Paxton.","In 2005, for instance, Abbott used part of a $1.4 million federal crime fighting grant to establish a voter fraud unit within his attorney general\u2019s office. One year later, the task force brought charges against 11 individuals. One involved a person illegally casting a ballot, the others involved people assisting seniors in casting mail-in ballots, according to the Lone Star Project.","In 2020, Paxton beefed up the voter fraud unit by dedicating more than 22,000 staff hours to voter fraud cases that year, doubling the time the office spent working on fraud cases in 2018, according to theHouston Chronicle. The result was 16 prosecutions, all involving Harris County residents who gave false addresses on their voter registration forms.","According to Ed Martin, a political strategist and former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party, the mounting resources invested in finding voter fraud over the years versus the few cases prosecuted shows Republicans\u2019 underlying agenda.","\"The consistent context has been an unrelenting national vote suppression agenda that is based on bogus fraud claims that are not supported by facts on the ground in Texas,\" Martin said.","And to Coleman, the attorney general\u2019s recent efforts to find voter fraud cases is an attempt to bolster former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claim that the 2020 election was rigged against him.","\"This is all about keeping Trump voters believing that the election was stolen,\" said Coleman. \"They wouldn't have to say that there 'are more than 100 (fraudulent ballots). That's enough. People will believe it was stolen.\"","Speaking during an Aug. 1 rally outside the Texas Capitol, state Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, framed the rationale behind Republican\u2019s voting legislation, which he authored, this way:","\"The other side, they used to say, \u2018There\u2019s no evidence of voter fraud.\u2019 And so we showed them evidence, and then they started saying, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no evidence of widespread voter fraud.\u2019 And our question to them has been, how much fraud is okay?\" he said."]}

We rated another assertion in the new postPants on Firein 2009. And the bulk of the claims in the recent post have been debunked by such fact checkers asSnopes.comas long ago as 2006.","Here is an abridged rundown of the assertions contained in the recent Facebook post, which the Los Angeles Times itselfhas long saidare not, in fact,attributableto its work.","\"1) 40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes.

(There are 10.2 million people, in LA County.)","\"All 10 of the above facts were published in the Los Angeles Times.\"","The post also says that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose picture accompanies the post, \"wants to put a Windfall Tax on all stock market profits (including Retirement fund, 401K and Mutual Funds)!\"","Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the post\u2019s specific claims.","As Snopes.com first noted, this figure also appears, without additional sourcing, in 2005 congressionaltestimonyby Heather Mac Donald, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. \"In Los Angeles, 95% of all outstanding warrants for homicide (which total 1,200 to 1,500) target illegal aliens,\" she wrote in her testimony. \"Up to two-thirds of all fugitive felony warrants (17,000) are for illegal aliens.\"","When we contacted Mac Donald in 2018, she said, \"This information was given to me by a member of the (Los Angeles Police Department), who was making a rough estimate. It refers to fugitive warrants; homicide suspects who were in the country illegally often return to their home countries when they are sought on a warrant.\"","Even if this number was accurate at the time \u2014 and it was provided anonymously rather than being an official statistic \u2014 it is a \"rough estimate\" that is a decade and a half old. Those qualifications do not appear in the meme circulating today.","Mac Donald never cited this figure in her 2005 testimony. We were unable to find any supporting evidence for it.","Medi-Cal is the name of California\u2019s Medicaid program, which covers low-income residents of the state, including, to a certain extent, undocumented immigrants.","In 2018, a spokeswoman for California's Department of Health Care Services provided PolitiFact with statistics for 2012 and 2013. The percentage was 13.4% in 2012 and 12.6% in 2013. We rated this statementFalse.","This is, at best, an assumption, because there\u2019s no official data to back it up. Neither the FBI or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has officially estimated the percentage of gang members who are in the United States illegally.","A2011 FBI assessmentsaid there were 1.4 million active street, prison, and outlaw motorcycle gang members affiliated with more than 33,000 gangs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. It\u2019s unclear how many of the 1.4 million were here illegally.","In a 2017six-week operation targeting all gang members, ICE arrested 1,378 individuals; 933 were U.S. citizens and 445 were foreign nationals. ICE didn\u2019t have a breakdown of the foreign nationals\u2019 immigration status.","This is another instance where the numbers just don\u2019t add up to support the claim. (In 2012, we rated itPants on Fire.)","Using updated data, there wereabout 9.7 millionpeople in subsidized housing in 2017, according to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.","So 60% of the 9.7 million would mean that about 5.8 million of those housing-subsidized residents were people here illegally, whichexperts have told us\"seems implausible\" and \"nonsensical.\"","A 2015 report by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low levels of immigration, estimated that in 2012, 4% of households headed by immigrants in the country illegally used housing programs. \"While households headed by illegal immigrants make some use of housing and cash programs, their use is lower than that of households headed by the native-born for these programs,\"the study said.","On Sept. 7, 2009, theLos Angeles Times publisheda column by Hector Tobar. He listed these assertions in order to debunk them and to decry what was then a new phenomenon of people sharing thinly sourced facts via chain emails.","\"The authors of the chain e-mail and the phony government report fear what Los Angeles has become \u2014 a multilingual, multiethnic city with multicultural tastes,\" Tobar wrote. \"They search for information to persuade others to be afraid, but the actual numbers don\u2019t quite add up to the big monster they think is out there. So they make the numbers bigger. Or they just make them up. And they spread them around until all that fear and anger turns into a big hate.\"","This one comes from a different direction, but it has also been circulating since at least 2006, just before the Democrats won control of the House. As far back as 2009, we rated itPants on Fire.","Pelosi\u2019s office told PolitiFact that \"internet and e-mail rumors indicating that I support a windfall profits tax on earnings from the stock market are completely and utterly fabricated.\" She added, \"My record on promoting retirement security and strengthening 401(k)'s and other savings incentives in the tax code contradict these rumors.\"","Snopes.comandFactCheck.orgalso debunked this assertion."]}

Doctors said it was cherry picked, and it came from another vaccine after-effects database, not VAERS.","When asked for evidence to support his claim about child hospitalizations caused by the COVID-19 vaccines, Cain pointed through a Fox News spokesperson not to VAERS, but toa slide from a June presentationby the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.","Theslidecited data from a newer vaccinedatabase, v-safe, which uses surveys sent through smartphones to collect information from vaccine recipients who voluntarily sign up.","The slide said that through mid June, 0.1% of v-safe enrollees ages 12 to 15 received \"medical care in emergency dept\/hospital\" after their first Pfizer dose, and 0.2% after their second.","Like VAERS, the v-safe database is subject to many limitations, and the responses it collectscannot be usedto establish causality. \"It\u2019s by no means a representative sample,\" O\u2019Leary said. \"That\u2019s (Cain) cherry-picking data and misusing data to represent his position.\"","\"V-safe does not record reason for hospitalization, and it cannot be determined whether hospitalization was related to vaccination,\" amore recent CDC reviewof v-safe data said.","That more recent report, published in August, reviewed v-safe responses through mid-July.

Worthington also reimbursed board members for travel expenses and other out-of-pocket costs.","The CantonRepositoryreportedthat Kasich quit the Worthington board upon winning the governor\u2019s race in 2010, but was still owed deferred compensation from the board. Kasich received $611,000 total in deferred compensation from Worthington, and at least $103,000 of the total came after he had been sworn in as governor.","That same company received $619,000 in tax breaks after Kasich took office","In the first bill he signed as governor, Kasich made good on a campaign promise to attract investment to Ohio. He nixed the Ohio Department of Development and created a private, nonprofit corporation called JobsOhio, explaining that in order to lure companies to the state, government needed to \"move at the speed of business.\"","Kasich designed JobsOhio to be funded by a lease on state liquor profits. He declared it exempt from public records requirements and state audits. And he made board appointments for JobsOhio a responsibility of the governor.","To drum up job creation, JobsOhio reviews potential opportunities to offer incentives such as tax breaks, and sends its recommendations to the Ohio Tax Credit Authority for final determination. The tax credit authority has a five-member board, and three of its appointees, including the chair, are Kasich\u2019s.","An Associated Press investigation found that, less than a year after JobsOhio was created, it recommended a series of tax incentives totalling $619,000 for Worthington Industries\u2019 subsidiaries, which the state tax credit board awarded.","Last year, the company laid off 100 Ohioans","In March 2015, Worthingtonannouncedit was cutting 555 jobs nationwide, which included 115 in Ohio. The company blamed the loss of these jobs --manufacturing cabs for large agricultural and mining equipment -- on industry-wide downturns.","Worthington spokeswoman Cathy Lyttletoldthe CantonRepositorythat any incentives the company receives are only paid when the company delivers the jobs it promised. She said that pursuing tax incentives is standard business practice, and Worthington received $400,000 in tax breaks under the previous, Democratic regime of governor Ted Strickland.","Company\u2019s CEO donates half-million to Kasich\u2019s presidential bid","The Center for Responsive Politicsconfirmsa $500,000 contribution from Worthington CEO John P.

Plants produce electricity using fossil fuels or renewable energies, while the grid ensures that power gets to the areas that need it.","Jorge Carmacho, a senior policy advisor at Urban Ingenuity who assessed the electric infrastructure damages after the hurricanes for the government of Puerto Rico, estimated roughly 30 percent of the generating plants were not operational before the storm hit. He identified two reasons.","One is non-compliance with Environmental Protection Agency rules, which set limits on fossil fuel burning. The other was maintenance, propagated by unprecedented oversight by Puerto Rico\u2019s recently created Energy Commission.","One of the main issues they were trying to fix was the grid, which Trump also mentioned. It is run by PREPA, a government utilities program, which is bankrupt, as Trump said. It faces $9 billion of debt.","Trump was right in saying it was in very bad shape.

About 10 to 15 percent of customers lost power after the first hurricane, Irma.","But coverage was spotty even before the hurricanes. In 2016, for example, a fire resulted in athree-day blackout.

The bonuses began April 5, 2020 and are available through July 31, 2020.","Here\u2019s how Graham came up with $24 per hour, or at least close to it, according to his Senate staff:","In South Carolina, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit is$326. If you add the $600 federal bonus, that\u2019s $926 per week. For a 40-hour work week, that comes to $23.15 per hour. (In some interviews about the $600 bonus, Graham said that would amount to $23 per hour.)","So that\u2019s pretty close to $24 per hour. But again, it\u2019s only for the unemployed in South Carolina receiving the maximum weekly unemployment payment.","Regular unemployment benefits vary by state. South Carolina\u2019s maximum is on the lower end, according to the latest Congressional Research Servicereport, from July 2019. The highest maximum, $1,192 per week, is in Massachusetts, which is among 11 states that add benefits for unemployed people with dependents.","Nationally, regular unemployment covers half your wages, up to a cap of about $450 in regular earnings per week, Heidi Shierholz, former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor, told PolitiFact. So, a person who normally earns $450 would receive $225 in regular unemployment benefits, plus the $600 bonus, or $825 per week  \u2014 more than their regular pay. That\u2019s about $21 per hour.","Viewed another way, as of January 2020, the average weekly unemployment benefit was $385 per week, Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told PolitiFact. Add $600 to that and that comes to more than $24 per hour.","But that\u2019s based on an average, not a national standard.","Burtless noted that unemployment payments vary not only by state, but also within a state from one recipient to another, because the benefit depends on each worker\u2019s earnings record.","Asked by Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity why the higher unemployment payments aren\u2019t capped at what a recipient made on the job, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchinsaidstate unemployment offices have 35-year-old computer systems, and a more complicated unemployment aid formula would have taken months to set up.","\"The simplest way was, and the fairest way was, $600 per person,\" Mnuchin said. \"In certain states, that might be a little bit too much money; in other states, it\u2019s less money. It\u2019s not a perfect system, but the president\u2019s objective was to make sure you get money in people\u2019s hands.\"","The main complaint of the Facebook claim, though, seemed to be that people who are still employed but earning less than $24 per hour aren\u2019t getting bonuses to boost them to that level.","Most adults will receive a one-time stimulus payment of $1,200, which is expected to occur in April 2020. But that goes to the unemployed as well as the employed.","In short, there is no additional pay from this stimulus package for people who remain employed. That includes people in essential jobs such as grocery store clerks, delivery workers, food and medical supply-chain workers, and lower-paid hospital staff.","An earlier federal stimulus law \u2014 the Families First Coronavirus Response Act \u2014 gave all American businesses with fewer than 500 employees funds to provide employees with paid leave, either for the employee\u2019s own health needs or to care for family members. That will help many workers who previously didn\u2019t get paid sick leave from their employer."]}

At aHouse Appropriations Committee meetingthe day after the crash, the Republican majority cast votes to cut grants to Amtrak for capital spending by about 15 percent. Democrats and Republicans squabbled over both the substance and the timing of the move.","At a news conference, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, rejected criticism by Democrats that linked congressional funding cuts to the crash. \"Listen, you know they started this yesterday -- \u2018It\u2019s all about funding, It\u2019s all about funding.\u2019 Well, obviously, it\u2019s not about funding,\" Boehner said. \"The train was going twice the speed limit. Adequate funds were there. No money's been cut from rail safety, and the House passed a bill earlier this spring to reauthorize Amtrak and authorize a lot of these programs.\"","To that, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded, \"Speaker Boehner\u2019s comments are patently false. Experts have made clear that positive train control could have prevented the tragedy in Philadelphia. It is simply a fact that insufficient funding for Amtrak has delayed the installation of PTC, and to deny a connection between the accident and underfunding Amtrak is to deny reality.\"","A reader asked us to check whether Schumer was correct. What we found is that money is indeed one obstacle, but not the only one.","Positive train control and its pricetag","A positive train control system uses signals and sensors along the track to communicate train location, speed restrictions, and moving authority, according to theCongressional Research Service. If the train is going too fast, equipment onboard automatically acts to slow or stop it.","In 2008, aMetrolink train crash in Chatsworth, Calif., killed 25 people and injured more than 100; investigators blamed the engineer for texting while driving. In response, Congress voted to require most of the national rail system -- about 60,000 miles -- to be updated with positive train control by December 2015. Amtrak wasmaking progresson that goal and had installed positive train control on portions of the Northeast Corridor, but it had not yet done so on the stretch of track in Philadelphia where the accident occurred. Amtrak CEO Joseph BoardmantoldtheNew York Timesthat the system was close to being operational throughout the Northeast Corridor by the end of this year.","Schumer has a point that cost has been an obstacle in meeting Congress\u2019 requirements, both for private freight-rail companies and for Amtrak, which is dependent on federal funding.","The Federal Railroad Administration has estimated that implementation of positive train control will cost roughly $14 billion. To put that in context, capital investment by U.S. railroads in 2010 amounted to $11 billion, about two-thirds for structures and one-third for equipment. So the estimated cost of meeting the mandate is \"roughly equal to the railroads\u2019 total capital spending in a single year,\" according to the Congressional Research Service.","When Congress enacted the requirement for positive train control, it did not designate funds to carry it out. Private freight rail carriers have dipped into their corporate pockets to install the new system -- and they acknowledge that they are behind schedule -- but Amtrak had little choice but to go to Congress to secure funding.","\"Projects of this magnitude take many years for any public agency to work into their capital budgets,\" said Karl Witbeck, a principal in the transportation practice of the consulting firm Stantec. There\u2019s \"no doubt the lack of capital funding has paid a large role in the delay of finishing the implementation of PTC for Amtrak.\"","The rest of the picture","However, Schumer\u2019s statement glossed over other factors that have hampered the implementation of positive train control. Here are a few of those suggested to us by experts.","\u2022Amtrak\u2019s failure to seek, prioritize and use the money it did have. Areportby the Amtrak inspector general released on Dec. 20, 2012, cited several obstacles in implementing Congress\u2019 positive train control mandate. One was Amtrak\u2019s failure to come up with \"complete and reliable cost estimates and budgeting\" for the system. The report called the budgeting process \"fragmented,\" noting that two different Amtrak departments are responsible for estimating the costs of positive train control, depending on whether the installation is on property owned by Amtrak or another entity.","The report also says Amtrak never asked for enough funds to finish the project in either its five-year financial plan or its fiscal year 2013 budget request to Congress. A Transportation Department official was quoted in the report stating that the department purposely omitted installation costs from these documents because they \"would weaken Amtrak\u2019s negotiating position with the host railroads because it would alert the railroads to the amount of money that was potentially available to pay these costs.\" (Amtrak did not provide answers to questions submitted to PolitiFact by publication time.)","\u2022The system is technologically challenging. Even if funding posed no obstacle, overlaying a positive train control system over decades-old rail lines is a complex task. Positive train control \"is not off-the-shelf technology and has had to be developed from scratch,\" said Ed Greenberg, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, whose members include most major rail carriers, including Amtrak.","In order to work properly, positive train control needs a certain amount of radio frequency available for the various pieces of the system to communicate with one another. The inspector general\u2019s report cited this as the \"most serious challenge\" to implementing positive train control.","The Federal Communications Commission -- which oversees the frequency spectrum --toldtheNew York Timesthat regulatory delays in approving antenna installation are now \"largely gone.\" Still, the accumulation of past delays, whether attributable to the FCC or to Amtrak, have pushed back the implementation of positive train control, experts say.","Part of the problem for Amtrak has been a need to purchase the rights to radio frequencies on the open market, from existing companies that use that spectrum.","\"When spectrum is in short supply, as is the case in many urban areas, the railroads have to go to the secondary market and purchase it at a premium,\" said Joseph C. Szabo, a former administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration.","Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, emphasized that the senator was not implying that the delay wassolelythe result of insufficient funds, but rather that it was a contributing, and perhaps even primary, driver of that delay. In addition, he said, the challenges of purchasing spectrum rights are intricately linked to Amtrak\u2019s budgetary shortcomings. \"Had there been sufficient funding, the installation and broadband acquisition processes would have begun earlier and could have moved faster, and thus ended earlier,\" House said.","Our ruling"]}

So, clearly there are more than 18 people involved in tracking them.","According to Cook, there are more than 4,000 members of the security staff in the prisons and more than 1,100 probation and parole agents.

We led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.\"","Did Obamacare contain a bailout for insurance companies, and did Rubio and congressional Republicans get rid of it? In short, they postponed a provision of the law, but it wasn\u2019t a bailout.","Risky business","What Rubio calls a bailout is actually a part of the Affordable Care Act known as \"risk corridors.\"","When the health care law started requiring insurance companies to sell policies to everyone (even sick people with pre-existing conditions), those companies were caught in a tough spot. They didn\u2019t know how much to charge in premiums to cover expenses for all those new policies.","So the law set up a three-year period, from 2014 to 2016, during which the government would spread the risk for insurers in the new law\u2019s marketplaces while they adjusted premiums. This program is known as risk corridors.","If a company is good at setting its rates and make more than a certain amount, they pay Washington some of their extra money. These are called user fees. If a company is not so good at setting rates and loses money, the government would cover some of their losses.","That\u2019s the bailout to which Rubio is referring. He started calling ita \"bailout\" for unsuccessful insurance companiesin 2013, the same year heintroduced an ill-fated bill in the Senateto repeal the program.","But let\u2019s be clear: Several experts told us risk corridors aren\u2019t a bailout. A bailout is usually a program that saves a company after the fact. Risk corridors are a mechanism that was put in place to deal with a problem that everyone assumes could occur.","And they aren\u2019t new, either. The risk corridors program wasmodeled after a successful planthat was part of George W. Bush\u2019s Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, albeitslightly differentthan the Obamacare version. No one referred to that as a bailout.","Finding money for payments","Now, part of the problem is that the the health care law didn\u2019t say where it would get the money for any risk corridor payments. Remember those user fees from successful insurers? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, later decided they would use that money to make any payments owed to insurers that weren\u2019t so successful.","In 2013, CMS said insurers who said they needed money would get it, \"regardless of the balance of payments and receipts\" in the program. Rubio took this to mean that if there wasn\u2019t enough money from user fees to cover the payments, the White House would ask Congress for money -- that is, tax revenue.","CMS said in April 2014 it wouldn\u2019t ask Congress for an appropriation, but insteadwould make up the difference in later yearsif the marketplace didn\u2019t bring in enough user fees. Rubio went to work, urging then-Speaker of the House John Boehner in October 2014 toblock potential tax money appropriations for risk corridor payments.","That\u2019s what Congress did. When lawmakerspassed a spending bill in December 2014, it included special language called a \"rider\" that said the CMS\u2019 parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could not use any extra money in its budgetto pay risk corridor expenses. That effectively locked CMS into its stated plan of using user fees. (The same rider was included in the2015 spending bill.)","Some legislators have credited Rubio with inspiring this language, although there have been questions about how much credit he can take. Rubioreintroduced his billto repeal risk corridors.","By October 2015, it became apparent the risk corridors program didn\u2019t work so well in the first year. CMS announced the programtook in $362 million in user fees for 2014, while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion, leaving a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can\u2019t pay.","CMS said it would pay out12.6 percent of claimsfrom 2014, then wait to see next year\u2019s results. Some insurers left the marketplaces or evencollapsed altogether, leading Rubio to crow his actions have been \"a big part of ending Obamacare for good.\" (We likely won't know what the program took in for 2015 until fall 2016, and 2016\u2019s totals until 2017.)","Whether it will really kill Obamacare is up for debate. Some legal scholars have said all the rider did was highlight a problem the law already had and prevent a workaround. Two years ago, the Congressional Budget Office said the risk corridorswill likely eventually break evenby 2016.","If the program doesn\u2019t, CMS will have to find the money somehow or ask Congress to make an appropriation to pay insurers. Otherwise,insurers could sueto get those payments. An Oregon insurance company that is no longer offering marketplace plans did just that on Feb. 24,suing the government for $5 billionover missed risk corridors payments.","Our ruling"]}

But sanctions play at least some role \u2014 though it\u2019s hard to evaluate exactly how much given the country\u2019s oil crisis.","Tata is right that Russia\u2019s economy has struggled in recent years, though his numbers are a little off. More critically, sanctions are only part of the reason for Russia's economic troubles. We rate his statement Half True."],"full_article":["Since President Donald Trump took office, the Russian military haspatrolled the U.S. East Coastwith a spy ship,buzzed an American warshipwith a fighter jet in the Black Sea, anddefied an arms control treatyby deploying a new cruise missile.","These sorts of military exercises aren\u2019t far out of the ordinary, but they have drawn more attention than usual amid heightened concern about Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.","Russian President Vladimir Putin is testing Trump\u2019s response, just as any country would when its adversary gets a new leader, said CNN national security commentatorAnthony Tata, a former Army brigadier general and novelist. Another explanation, Tata said, is Putin is trying to divert attention from Russia\u2019s struggling economy.","\"Putin is our enemy, there\u2019s no question about that, and his country is imploding,\" Tata said on CNN Feb. 19. \"The sanctions that we put on them for the Crimea annexation and meddling in Ukraine, so they could get more natural resources down there ... have absolutely crushed the ruble by 50 percent. And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well.\"","Speculation abounds regarding whether Trump might roll back sanctions against Russia or soften the U.S. position on Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine, so we were curious about Tata\u2019s claim that the sanctions have damaged the Russian economy.","Tata has the general trend right \u2014 Russia\u2019s economy is struggling, no question \u2014 but his numbers are slightly off. Additionally, experts said sanctions may have impacted the Russian economy, but not nearly as much as the drop in oil prices worldwide.","Numbers are close","Tata claims 50 percent drops for both Russia\u2019s currency and gross domestic product since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, a region of Ukraine. Former President Barack Obama's administration first launched sanctions against Russia in response in March 2014. The European Union soon followed with its own sanctions.","Separately, Obamaimposed additional sanctionsin late 2016, after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russian actors interfered in the U.S. presidential election.","Starting with Russia\u2019s currency,the ruble has lost significant valuesince the 2014 sanctions were put in place. In February 2014, one ruble was worth about 2.8 cents. Then the value dropped steeply over the next couple years, reaching a low point of about 1.2 cents per ruble in January 2016. That\u2019s an approximately 57 percent drop.","However, despite the fact that the sanctions remain in place, the ruble has steadily creeped up over the past year, reaching a value of 1.7 cents per ruble as of Feb. 21, 2017. That\u2019s about 40 percent less than the value before the sanctions went into effect.","Russia\u2019s GDP has also fallen over the past couple years. Tata specifically mentioned 2014-16.Russia\u2019s GDPwas  $2.053 trillion (in U.S. dollars) in 2014, according to the World Bank, dropping to $1.331 trillion in 2015 \u2014 a drop of about 35 percent.","Adjusted for inflation, however, the drop was more like 3.7 percent because of the struggling ruble.","Russia\u2019s 2016 GDP is not yet available, but theRussian government has reportedvery little change from 2015.","Effect of the sanctions","The U.S. sanctions against Russia targeted specific individuals, firms and sectors close to Putin. For example, they froze U.S.-held assets that belong to some major Russian companies and banks.","Experts had mixed opinions about the extent of the sanctions\u2019 impact on Russia\u2019s economy compared with other factors, notably falling oil prices.","Declining oil prices worldwide since 2012 are the primary reason for Russia\u2019s economic woes given the country\u2019s dependence on oil revenue and exports, said Susanne Wengle, a University of Notre Dame professor who studies Russia\u2019s political economy.","The Russian government\u2019s revenue is tied to oil prices, so a struggling oil industry significantly affects both the private and public sector, Wengle said. In its long-term budget projections, Russia assumed oil prices above $100 per barrel, but in 2016, prices sometimes dropped below $30.","If the sanctions weren\u2019t in place, \"the Russian economy would likely have struggled just as much,\" she said.","Beyond oil, Russia strained its budget by intervening in Crimea and depleting its reserves during the global financial crisis in 2008-09, said Sarah Wilson Sokhey, a University of Colorado, Boulder, professor who studies Russian politics and its economy.","Although Sokhey doesn\u2019t think the sanctions have had a huge impact on the economy as a whole, she said certain individuals who do international business or who import certain products, especially foods, have taken a hit. For example, Russia banned importing European cheeses as a counter-sanction, so local cheesemakers had to make their ownbrieinstead of getting it from France.","\"It\u2019s not a trivial thing,\" Sokhey said of the sanctions. \"The Russian government would like to get rid of them, but it\u2019s not something that is seriously hurting them or leading to widespread discontent.\"","Mitchell Orenstein, a University of Pennsylvania professor and expert on the political economy in Eastern Europe, said he believes sanctions have significantly impacted the Russian economy by massively limiting foreign investment in Russia. The sanctions exacerbate the oil crisis by limiting Russian access to technology and capital.","\"Sanctions are certainly a big part of the economic decline in Russia, which explains why President Putin has made it such a high priority to get rid of sanctions,\" Orenstein said. \"It makes it much less attractive for companies to do business in or with Russia.\"","TheInternational Monetary Fund has saidinternational sanctions and the oil price drop were \"dual shocks\" to the Russian economy. The organizationestimatedthat all sanctions against Russia for its activity in Ukraine, as well as Russia\u2019s own counter-sanctions, could reduce inflation-adjusted GDP by up to 1.5 percent.","For a more thorough rundown of economic analyses regarding the impact of sanctions on Russia, see thisFeb. 17, 2017, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.","In an email, Tata told PolitiFact that he did not mean sanctions are the only cause of Russia\u2019s economic problems. Rather, he was making a broader point that Putin is trying to shift eyes away from his country\u2019s economic issues.","\"Of course, there are other factors, but Putin despises the West in part because of the sanctions,\" he said.","Our ruling"]}

With those missing caveats, we rate Maddow's claim Half True."],"full_article":["There\u2019s no love lost between MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Fox News. The liberal show host frequently chastises the conservative Fox News, and the network\u2019s process of picking the top 10 candidates for the first Republican presidential debate gave Maddow another opportunity.","Maddow aimed her barb at the explanation Fox News gave for deciding who would be the last candidate to make the cut-off. Fox News gave Ohio Gov. John Kasich the coveted 10th slot at the expense of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry.","Maddow accused Fox News of unilaterally sounding the death knell for the lesser-ranked candidates seven months before the first Iowa voter would show up at the nation\u2019s first caucus.","\"If a candidate can't even make it to the debate stage, why would rational donors and volunteers continue giving money and time to what is apparently a lost cause,\" Maddow said on her Aug. 4, 2015, show.","A bit later, Maddow said, \"Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate.\"","In particular, Maddow chastised Fox for not using an NBC\/Wall Street Journalpoll that was the fifth-most recent poll on record. Fox News skipped that poll and used a slightly older poll from Quinnipiac. Maddow said this shift cost Rick Perry a shot at the nomination.","\"He didn't lose it, it was stolen from him,\"  she said. \"Not because of the vagaries of some poll but because of some cable news executives moving things around to effectively stack things against him.\"","Maddow compared what Fox News had said before and what it said after it made its picks. In this fact-check, we focus just on the question of whether Fox changed the rules of the game for the polls it would use.","Fox News became more nuanced with the polls","In May, when Fox Newsfirst announced the debates, it laid down several selection criteria for the candidates. Among them was this: \"Must place in the top 10 of an average of the five most recent national polls, as recognized by FOX News leading up to August 4th at 5 PM\/ET. Such polling must be conducted by major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques.\"","Fox News directed us to aBloomberg articlethat added just one detail from Michael Clemente, executive vice president of news for Fox. Clemente said online and partisan polls were unacceptable.","But onAug. 4, when Fox News unveiledwho would make it to the main stage (a forum for the runners-up takes place earlier at 5 p.m.), it gave a far more detailed explanation of its selection rules than what it laid out in May:","\u2022 \"They are the five most recent national polls from non-partisan, nationally-recognized organizations using standard methodological techniques. Recency was determined by actual interview dates (not release date).\"","\u2022 \"They used live interviewers, random digit-dial sampling techniques and included both landlines and cellphones. (No online or automated (IVR) polls were used.)\"","\u2022 \"Their GOP primary vote question mirrored the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics.\"","\u2022 \"Results among registered voters were used rather than national adult results when available. Furthermore, only results among either 1) self-identified Republican primary voters or 2) Republican and Republican-leaning voters were used.\"","\u2022 \"The rank order was determined by a simple arithmetic average of publicly available results. Averages were rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point.\"","\u2022 \"Each poll has a different margin of error, and averaging requires a distinct test of statistical significance. Given the over 2,400 interviews contained within the five polls, from a purely statistical perspective it is at least 90% likely that the tenth place Kasich is ahead the eleventh place Perry.\"","\u2022 \"We did not include the highly-respected NBC\/WSJ poll, which is the fifth most recent poll, only because it did not meet our criterion that the poll read the names of each Republican candidate in the vote question. We would note, however, even though their ballot question included Perry but did not name Kasich, the unaided \"Kasich\" response tied the aided \"Perry\" response. In short, their results are consistent with the results of the other polls in our review, and consistent with the resulting placement in the Fox News debate.\"","In May, Fox News took 45 words to describe how it would use polls to pick the candidates. In August, it used more than 260. Without a doubt, Fox moved from a broad to a detailed approach. We turned to political scientists to help us assess whether that shift is the same as Maddow\u2019s claim that \"Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria.\"","A change of uncertain significance","The bottom line from the analysts we reached is that the original poll criteria were destined to be insufficient to meet the goal of giving Fox News a clear ranking of the top 10. During her show, Maddow interviewed Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia Center for Politics. We asked Sabato to assess her statement.","\"We were never sure which polls could be included and which could not, beyond the requirements about live calls\/interviewers and the like,\" Sabato told PunditFact. \"You can call it \u2018changing the rules\u2019 if you want, but you could also say they reserved to themselves some flexibility, not knowing precisely what the polling community would serve up.\"","David P. Redlawsk, a political scientist at Rutgers University, said Fox could have done more to avoid this situation.","\"They added criteria after they saw what the polls were,\" Redlawsk said. \"To me this is different. Fox should have been more specific from the beginning.\"","By comparison, in May,CNN named the pollsit would use for the debates it plans for September and provided a much more detailed description of how it would use those polling results.","That said, Fox News\u2019 decision to use polls based on when they called voters and how they posed their questions passed muster with Robert Erikson at Columbia University.","\"If Kasich was not on the NBC\/WSJ ballot, the Fox decision makes sense,\" Erikson said. \"Release data is less important than date in the field. It was my impression that even with NBC\/WSJ included, Perry would lose out, only by an even more trivial amount.\"","Michael Traugott, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, has taken a careful look at how news organizations use polls.He wrote a critique of CNN\u2019s \"poll of polls\" after the 2008 election.","\"The most important point is that the system is arbitrary, used to satisfy production values for television rather than being based on any substantive or political consideration,\" he told us. \"The network is trying to use a statistical justification to cover a news judgment decision.\"","Traugott said that taking the average of candidate standing in polls is a bad idea on a number of grounds. Mainly, differences in how polling organizations chose their respondents and phrase their questions have a much greater impact than the statistical margin of error.","Traugott said that in large measure, Fox set itself up for this problem.","\"If you are vague initially, when the time comes, you have to specify the details by which you acted,\" he said.","We contacted both MSNBC and Fox News. MSNBC said Maddow\u2019s statement was correct based on Fox News adding the criteria that the GOP primary vote question mirror \"the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics.\" Fox News declared that this made no difference.","Our ruling"]}

Sometimes they just shout their corrections in real time.","This happened on March 13, during remarks on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C.","It came when Kevin Downing, the attorney for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, addressed reporters and onlookers moments after his client had been sentenced by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to an additional 43 months in prison for illegal lobbying and hiding the proceeds.","The sentencing by Jackson was Manafort\u2019s second in just a few days. U.S. District Judge T.S.

The Washington Post counted226 timesTrump had used the phrase in any context through March 8.","Read more: Donald Trump says collusion is not a crime. That\u2019s not right","If Trump could get a federal judge \u2014 or two \u2014 to give their imprimatur to that assertion, it would be a persuasive talking point.","But that\u2019s not what Jackson said. (We are awaiting an official court transcript of her remarks from the bench; until then, we\u2019re relying onmediaaccountsof what she said.)","In her remarks from the bench, Jackson made a point of pushing back against the \"no collusion\" argument she read in the defense\u2019s sentencing memorandum.","\"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 refrain that runs through the entire defense memorandum is unrelated to the matter at hand,\" she said, adding, \"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 mantra is simply a non sequitur.\"","She also said, \"The \u2018no collusion\u2019 mantra is also not accurate, because the investigation is still ongoing.\"","So, contrary to Downing\u2019s remarks, Jackson didn\u2019t give Manafort a clean bill of health on alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Instead, she said it wasn\u2019t at issue in the cases that reached her courtroom.","So what about Downing\u2019s assertion that another court had also given its stamp of approval to the \"no collusion\" argument? That\u2019s incorrect, too.","He was presumably referring to theearlier sentencingby Ellis in the Virginia case. In fact, Downingmade that casein astatement to reporterson the courthouse steps after Ellis handed down Manafort\u2019s sentence.","\"There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official from Russia,\" Downing said.","Soon after, Trump cited Ellis and Downing as support for the \"no collusion\" thesis in atweet. \"Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr.

But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!","But that isn\u2019t what Ellis said, either.","Here\u2019s the relevant portion of what Ellis said, according to the official court transcript: \"He is not before the court for any allegation that he or anybody at his direction colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election.\"","To emphasize the point, Ellis repeated it shortly thereafter. \"He's not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government to influence this election.\""]}

Here\u2019s what you need to know.","Who was Ida B. Wells?","Wells was born in Mississippi in 1862 and grew up during the Reconstruction era following the Civil War.","She was 30 years old and working as a newspaper editor in Memphiswhen she startedreporting on lynchings in the South. Her work, which relied on documents and included eye-witness interviews, challenged the notion that black men were rapists. When her work ran in The Memphis Free Speech and Headlight, a newspaper she co-owned, she faced death threats and, in 1892, the offices of her newspaper weredestroyed by a mob.","In 1884 \u2014 71 years before Rosa Parksrefused to give up her seat on a bus in 1955\u2014  railroad workersforcibly removed Wells from a traintravelingfrom Memphis to Woodstock, Tenn., after she refused to leave a car reserved for white women.","Wells moved to Chicago in the early 1890s. In 1895,she married Ferdinand L. Barnett, the editor of the Chicago Conservator,the city\u2019s first African American newspaper. Paula Giddings writes in her book,\"A Sword Among Lions,\"that Wells took majority ownership of that paper around the time of her wedding, when she was 33 going on 34.","What were her politics?","Wells\u2019 father, James Wells, advocated for the rights of newly freed black people and worked with the Republican Party during Reconstruction,the Washington Postreported. Both of her parents were active in the Republican Party,according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.","Living in Chicago, Ida Wells and her husband were politically loyal to Charles S. Deneen, a leading Republican in Illinois,the introduction of Wells\u2019 autobiography, \"Crusade for Justice,\"says. As state\u2019s attorney, Deneen appointed Barnett assistant state\u2019s attorney, and he was the first black man to hold that position.","When Ida Wells later ran for Illinois State Senate (and lost) in 1930,she ran as an independent.","Daphene R. McFerren, executive director of the Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis, shared with PolitiFact an 1885 letter Wells wrote to the New York Freeman that underscores this point.","\"I am not a Democrat,\" Wells wrote, \"because the Democrats considered me a chattel and possibly might have always so considered me, because their record from the beginning has been inimical to my interests. I am not a Republican, because, after they \u2014 as a party measure and an inevitable result of the war \u2014 had \u2018given the Negro his freedom\u2019 and the ballot box following, all through their reign \u2014 while advocating the doctrine of the Federal Government\u2019s right to protecting her citizens \u2014 they suffered the crimes against the Negro, that have made the South notorious, to go unpunished and almost unnoticed and turned them over to the tender mercies of the South.\"","She goes on to say \"it is not in favor, nor against the interest of either party that I write this. Let a man be Democrat, Republican or Independent as his judgment dictates, if he is obeying honest and intelligent convictions.\"","Women were not granted the right to vote until about a decade before Wells\u2019 death in 1931, but  McFerren said, \"what black person wasn\u2019t a Republican after the Civil War?\"","The Republican Party was then the party of President Abraham Lincoln, and it was unheard of for a black person to be a Democrat from 1920 to about the 1940s, she said. That shifted during the 1950s and 60s as black people starting voting for Democrats, she said, and the historical context matters.","\"To say a black person is a Republican of her era is a compliment, it has no relationship to how we understand Republicans today,\" McFerren said. \"Labeling her as a Republican when they\u2019re trying to use her in a contemporary sense is ridiculous.\"","\"Of course she was a Republican!\" Theodore Karamanski, a history professor at Loyola University Chicago, told us. But, he added, \"the GOP was at that time the party of Lincoln NOT the party of Trump or even Reagan. Most African Americans were Republicans in the 1940s. The Republican Party switched its policies regarding African Americans with the Democrats in the 1960s.\"","Has she been ignored?","Last year, the New York Timesran a belated obituary for Wells. That\u2019s because since 1851, a few years before Wells was born, the newspaper\u2019s obituary pages were dominated by news of the deaths of white men. The paperin 2018 set outto rectify the record in an ongoing project called \"Overlooked,\" which seeks to recognize the legacies of other remarkable people in its obituary pages.","\"Wells is considered by historians to have been the most famous black woman in the United States during her lifetime,\" the New York Times obit says, \"even as she was dogged by prejudice, a disease infecting Americans from coast to coast. She pioneered reporting techniques that remain central tenets of modern journalism. And as a former slave who stood less than five feet tall, she took on structural racism more than half a century before her strategies were repurposed, often without crediting her, during the 1960s civil rights movement.\"","She organized economic boycotts before civil rights activists who were mostly men were credited with the tactic\u2019s success, according to the Times. As she aged, her influence waned while activists likeBooker T. WashingtonandW.E.B.

Wells was one of the most fearless and one of the most respected women in the United States.\"","In June 2018, though,the Washington Post reportedthat her pioneering work was \"all but unrecognized in (Chicago), which has no shortage of statues and monuments to leading white men.\" But, the Post said, \"Wells is enjoying fresh attention.\" Hundreds of thousands of dollars were raised to build a monument to Wells there. The National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala., features a selection of quotes and a stone inscribed with her name. The Ida B. Wells Legacy Committee was formed to support the candidacies of black women. This year, a major downtown thoroughfare in Chicagowas renamed after Wells.","Back in 1991, the Chicago Tribuneran a storyabout Wells that called her an \"inspiration.\" But in 2018,the Guardian called her\"the unsung heroine of the civil rights movement.\"","Responding to a Twitter account that tweeted the same image that was used in the Facebook post, Nikole Hannah-Jones, a New York Times reporter and co-founder of the Ida B. Wells Society, which seeks to increase the ranks and influence of journalists of color doing investigative work, said: \"We know who the hell she is.\"","\"Y\u2019all need to stop this,\" Hannah-Jonestweeted in February 2018. \"If the modern Republican Party wants to adopt the platform it had during Ida B. Wells\u2019s time \u2014 like sweeping civil rights legislation, reparations \u2014 then every black American would be Republican again. Stop being dumb.\"","Later that year,she responded to another Twitter accountthat said Wells didn\u2019t get the credit she deserved for refusing to give up her train seat because she was a conservative Republican.","\"Ida B. Wells was a conservative Republican,\" Hannah-Jones said. \"I think I almost choked on this one. The Republicans at the time of Ida B. Wells were radically liberal, pushing for massive expansion of govt in the protection of black civil rights.\"","\"She didn\u2019t \u2018get credit,\u2019\" Hannah-Jones said, \"because white, racist conservatives burned her newspaper down when she exposed the lie of why black men were lynched and then across the South white conservatives systematically implemented black codes to force black people back in to quasi-slavery.\"","Today, McFerren said, Wells is \"celebrated everywhere,\" and she\u2019s enjoyed a renaissance in the past several years.","Karamanski told us that if you haven\u2019t heard of Ida B. Wells, \"it is because you have been willfully ignorant of Chicago history, women\u2019s history, and African American history. It is NOT because she was Republican.\"","Our ruling"]}

Other claims haveinvolvedHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other lawmakers.","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared on CNN\u2019sState of the Unionon March 15 to answer questions from host Dana Bash about what she called the \"rushed way\" the letter was circulated as senators were trying to get out of town for a snowstorm.

Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) when he was the majority leader flying to Moscow during the negotiations over the SALT II treaty, explaining to the Russians the Senate's role in treaty ratification. And John Kerry, when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism. So, look, members of Congress expressing themselves about important matters, not only at home, but around the world, is not unprecedented.\"","Since Kerry, many years later, is a central player in the Iran negotiations, we decided to focus on the claim that referenced him. (Indeed, on Sunday, Kerry said on CBS\u2019sFace the Nationthat the letter from the 47 senators \"was absolutely calculated directly to interfere with these negotiations. ... That is unprecedented.\")","There are some differences between the recent examples and the Kerry visit -- including the fact that the Nicaragua episode involved two individual lawmakers rather than87 percent of the Senate GOP caucus, including the majority leader. But we\u2019ll leave it to readers to judge whether McConnell\u2019s comparison is apt.","Here, we\u2019ll look instead at the more straightforward factual question of whether Kerry, \"when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism.\"","When we dug into the archives, we found that the episode in question occurred almost exactly 30 years ago, in April 1985. It came at a time when Ortega, Nicaragua\u2019s communist strongman, was being challenged by a U.S.-aligned rebel movement known as the Contras. (Now, after a period out of office in the 1990s, Ortega is once again Nicaragua\u2019s president.)","Here\u2019s how the Associated Press covered Kerry\u2019s comments in an April 16, 1985, dispatch:","\"Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said Monday he and another Vietnam-era veteran, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, plan to go to Nicaragua this week in part because of worries the United States is repeating the mistakes of Vietnam in Central America.","\"Kerry said he and Harkin plan to meet with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and with business, church and opposition leaders.","\"Their trip comes the week before the Senate is scheduled to vote on President Reagan's request for an additional $14 million in aid to the \u2018contra\u2019 rebels seeking to overthrow Ortega's leftist government.","\"Sen. Harkin and I are going to Nicaragua as Vietnam-era veterans who are alarmed that the Reagan administration is repeating the mistakes we made in Vietnam,\" Kerry said.","\"Our foreign policy should represent the democratic values that have made our country great, not subvert those values by funding terrorism to overthrow governments of other countries,\" Kerry said. ... Kerry said he and Harkin plan to leave Thursday for Nicaragua and return on Saturday.\"","This provides support for what McConnell said. We see only two inaccuracies, both around the margins.","First, the way McConnell structured his claim suggests that Kerry made these statements after flying to Managua. In reality, the AP article makes it clear that he made the statement in the daysbeforehe and Harkin left for Managua.","Second, McConnell could have been more precise in how he relayed Kerry\u2019s use of the word \"terrorism.\" McConnell said Kerry \"accused the Reagan administration ofengagingin terrorism.\" That\u2019s a slight exaggeration of Kerry\u2019s words. Kerry actually said that the Reagan administration was \"fundingterrorism to overthrow governments of other countries.\" A slight rhetorical difference, but a difference nonetheless.","Still, McConnell\u2019s claim is pretty close to the mark.","Kerry\u2019s staff did not dispute the accuracy of the AP report. They did point PolitiFact to an April 24, 1985,Washington Poststory about the votes on the Contra aid bill. The article noted that the late Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., said it was \"wrong, wrong, wrong\" for Kerry and Harkin to visit Nicaragua the previous week and return with a negotiating proposal from President Daniel Ortega.","According to thePostarticle, \"Kerry responded by reading a letter from Secretary of State George P. Shultz endorsing the idea of congressional visits to all Central American nations, including Nicaragua.\" Kerry\u2019s comments at the time appear to accurately portray what Schultz wrote. Here\u2019s an excerpt; the full text is availablehere.","\"I strongly encourage members of Congress, of both parties and regardless of their views on Central America, to visit not only Nicaragua but all of the countries of the region,\" Schultz wrote. \"I would urge them to spend as much time there as their schedules will permit, to travel outside the capitals, and to talk with citizens in and out of government and of all political persuasions in order to better understand the difficult issues we must all resolve in forgoing a bipartisan policy on Central America. The Department of State will be pleased to assist members of Congress with their travel in any way possible.\"","Our ruling"]}

Plus, women can hit roadblocks in the job market even if they are educated.","The research shows that, too.","Obama\u2019s statement is accurate but it needs additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True."],"full_article":["Among the causes First Lady Michelle Obama has championed during her time in the White House is improving the lot of girls and women worldwide. About a year ago, Obama helped kick off Let Girls Learn, an interagency effort focused on educating adolescent girls.","\"Studies from the World Bank show that one extra year of secondary school can increase a girl's future income by 15 to 25 percent,\" Obama said in an interview with aU.S. Agency for International Development publication. \"And we know that when girls are educated, they are less likely to contract HIV, more likely to delay childbearing and vaccinate their children, and have lower maternal and infant mortality rates. Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country\u2019s GDP.\"","We\u2019ve seen that claim about educating girls and a rising GDP before. Is it true?","Largely, yes. Research does show that a higher percentage of girls in school correlates with a higher gross domestic product. But those findings are much more limited than many people understand.","Behind all the research, there\u2019s uncertainty about whether a stronger economy leads to more girls in school, or if more girls in school leads to a stronger economy.","No single rule applies everywhere. A stronger economy, for instance, provides both the resources and incentives to educate more women, who go to school, earn more and boost the economy a little higher. But it doesn\u2019t always work that way. In the Middle East and North Africa, more women might be educated but for social and religious reasons, they can\u2019t work, or must work in jobs that don\u2019t fully reward their level of education.","And the biggest sticking point is that what\u2019s been called the \"girl effect\" seems to be much stronger in middle-income countries. For poorer nations, the effect is more muted.","A few key studies and cautions","The White House press office backed up the First Lady\u2019s claim by citing policy reports that declared that educating girls and young women would boost a country\u2019s economy.One from the World Banksaid \"By effectively educating more women -- that is, providing more women with a high-quality education -- more will enter the labor market, and the economy will show the favorable results.\"","Those reports didn\u2019t actually give the underlying research, so we\u2019ll cover the highlights.","\u2022 A 2009 article in the journalFeminist Economicscompared regions of the world and measured gender gaps in both education and employment. That\u2019s worth noting because, while the two generally go hand-in-hand, they are separate. You can educate girls, but if companies won\u2019t hire them, a lot of the economic benefit is lost.","This study\u2019s bottom line was that between 1960 and 2000, East Asia\u2019s growth rate was .9 percent higher than the region of the Middle East-North Africa. The difference was due to the higher fraction of girls in school in East Asia.","\u2022 A2011 World Bank studytook 14 countries and teased out what would happen if every girl finished whatever level of school she was in -- either primary or secondary. Not surprisingly, the economic impact depended hugely on a country\u2019s starting point. India and China, for example, had very low rates of girls not completing school, while on the opposite end, places like Burundi and Senegal had dropout rates over 80 percent.","So the study found that getting girls and young women to complete a given level of schooling added a \"barely noticeable\" amount in India and China, while in the other countries, researchers predicted a hefty rise.","One important contribution of this research is it factored in the diminishing returns of educating more women. When more people hit the job market, it tends to drive wages down. There\u2019s still a net gain, but in this study, earnings could be about 20 percent less than you might expect.","Tuck that point away and keep it in mind for the next landmark analysis on our list. It provided advocacy groups with a talking point that has gone viral.","\u2022 In a1999 World Bank paperGender inequality, income and growth: Are good times good for women?, economists David Dollar and Roberta Gatti worked with data on 100 nations. The finding that gained the most traction was that \"in the countries with higher initial education, an increase of 1 percentage point in the share of adult women with secondary school education implies an increase in per capita income growth of 0.3 percentage points.\"","That might seem like a simple equation, but it actually makes two points that are often overlooked.","The economic growth took place only in middle-income countries that already had a higher rate of educating women. \"For the poorer half of the observations, there is no relationship between female attainment and income,\" the authors wrote.","The other generally ignored element is that the 1 percent increase in educated women applies to completing secondary education. Simply putting more girls in classrooms at any grade level wouldn\u2019t necessarily deliver the same results. You have to get the girls all the way through high school.","Specifics are important when measuring education gains","Here\u2019s where many organizations,including USAID, get into trouble. They say -- right now on their website -- that \"if 10 percent more girls attend school, a country\u2019s GDP increases by an average of 3 percent.\"","That statement has three flaws. First, it treats all nations the same, whether they are low income or middle income. Second, it treats all education the same, whether it\u2019s primary or secondary.","Perhaps most troubling is it scales up the original equation by a factor of 10.","Dollar, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us that doing that \"is a bit risky.\"","\"You would expect diminishing returns,\" he said.","Which takes us back to that 2011 World Bank study we tucked away. It predicted wages would be about 20 percent lower than you would expect. Less money in women\u2019s pockets means less economic activity, and less economic growth.","Our ruling"]}

Democrats countered it was not fair to leave residents of those districts without representation for that long, noting the law requires elections to be held promptly.","Walker himself cited cost as a factor, speaking to reporters in Pewaukee:","\"It\u2019s just awaste of taxpayers\u2019money. The Legislature would be adjourned before a special election was held so (candidates would) ... have to be running for the fall election for a state legislative seat at the same time there would be a special election for a seat that wouldn\u2019t get to vote on anything until after the fall election anyway.\"","The seats had belonged to former state Sen. Frank Lasee of De Pere and former state Rep. Keith Ripp of Lodi. The two Republicans stepped down inDecember 2017to join Walker's administration.","Voters in those areas took Walker to court with the help of a group headed by Eric Holder, the first attorney general under Democratic President Barack Obama.","On March 22, 2018, Dane County Circuit Judge Josann Reynolds held Walker had a dutyunder state lawto hold special elections. A second Dane Countyjudge denied a delay. Sodid an appellate judge. Ultimately, Walker and the GOP dropped the matter instead of taking it to the state Supreme Court, and the elections were held.","So, Walker and Republicans did describe scheduling the elections as a waste of money, though they also cited other reasons. Chiefly, that the Legislature would be adjourned before a special election was held.","Presidential election","Now to the second part of Hintz\u2019s claim -- that Republicans are now \"talking about changing the rules to add additional elections that will cost millions of dollars of taxpayer expense.\"","On Nov. 15, 2018, theMilwaukee Journal Sentinel reportedRepublicans are considering using the lame-duck session -- while they still hold the governor\u2019s office -- to help keep a conservative on the state Supreme Court and give GOP lawmakers greater control of two state boards.","Republicans have been concerned about the 2020 state Supreme Court race because it is scheduled to be held alongside Wisconsin's presidential primary \u2014 when Democratic turnout is expected to far outpace Republican turnout, since Democrats will be deciding who will challenge President Donald Trump.","A turnout imbalance could spell trouble for Kelly, whom Walker appointed in 2016.","Republican legislative leaders, the Journal Sentinel reported, are looking at moving the 2020 presidential primary from April, possibly to March of that year. The GOP plan would require voters to go to the pollsthree timesin the spring of 2020 \u2014 likely in February, March and April.","Holding the extra election would indeed cost millions.","Nearly30 of Wisconsin's 72county clerks have come out against the proposal, noting -- among other issues -- the statewide cost of holding a standard spring election is around $7 million.","Hintz\u2019s statement was a bit off, however, in that he said the GOP was considering holding multiple extra elections. Only one is being considered.","Our rating"]}

Even doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes wouldn\u2019t cover this cost. It is just absurd.https:\/\/t.co\/8jijG73wEw","Sanders, however, found good news for his idea in the generally skeptical report.","In avideohe shared on social media July 30, he pointed out one of the report\u2019s findings that others had overlooked. Sanders tweaked the Koch brothers, the conservative donor family that has supported the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Virginia.","Sanders said, \"Let me thank the Koch Brothers of all people for sponsoring a study that shows that Medicare for All would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period. ... That is what is in the study of the Mercatus Center.\"","Thank you, Koch brothers, for accidentally making the case for Medicare for All!pic.twitter.com\/speuEL6ETC","Sanders\u2019 plan would essentially expand Medicare to cover everyone, rather than just those older than 65. Individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone\u2019s medical bills.","Sanders and his allies say this would end up saving money, because it would remove the middle-man of insurance companies, which drive up administrative costs, and and enable the government to use new bargaining power to rein in costs by providers.","Skeptics counter that those savings are not guaranteed, and the lack of a monetary incentive for patients to hold back on services could lead to increased use of the system, adding to the overall cost. In addition, with the government having to raise revenue to pay everyone\u2019s bills, taxes and the federal debt could go dangerously high, potentially canceling out or exceeding the money that individuals and families would save in higher take-home pay and lower health-care expenses.","In this article, we\u2019ll look at something much more narrow: whether Sanders is right that the Mercatus report says that single-payer would save the United States $2 trillion in health care outlays.","In a way, Sanders is right, though his assertion glosses over some caveats.","The Mercatus report included a table summarizing the financial effects of Sanders\u2019 bill. With a minimum of arithmetic, it\u2019s not hard to find the $2 trillion in question.","It\u2019s the difference between theDepartment of Health and Human Services\u2019 projectionof the amount of total health care spending in the United States, and what Mercatus thinks that number would be under Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All proposal. (See Table 2.)","Under Mercatus\u2019 projection for Medicare for All, the total amount of health expenditures would actually fall compared to what is expected under a continuation of the current system.","Specifically, total health care expenditures would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years, according to Mercatus.","So there\u2019s definitely something to what Sanders said.","The Mercatus report\u2019s author took issue with Sanders\u2019 focus on that figure.","Charles Blahous said that to come up with that estimate, Mercatus used a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders\u2019 plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payment will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent.","However, in an alternative scenario in which cost-control works less effectively (see Table 4) Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law.","So while the number Sanders chose really does appear in the report, he\u2019s cherry-picked the more flattering of two estimates.","Sanders\u2019 bill \"indicates that health providers would be paid at Medicare\u2019s payment rates, which are about 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurance,\" Blahous said. \"Obviously, immediately cutting payments to health care providers by roughly 40 percent would lower national health spending.\"","But would cuts that large actually occur (and without other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees)? This is where independent experts express caution.","Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model Sanders pointed to are \"not likely feasible,\" said John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it\u2019s a \"pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically.\"","In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem.","Josh Miller-Lewis, a spokesman for Sanders, focused instead on the impact on individuals, many of whom will end up ahead. \"Under Medicare for All with a progressive tax system, the vast majority of people will save money on health care,\" he said."]}

He stated that the agency maintains an electronic record on each person given a Social Security number and is supposed to update it when they die so their number can no longer be used.","The agency gets its death information from a variety of sources, such as family members, funeral homes and financial institutions. It maintains a \"Death Master File\" with nearly 90 million electronic records that\u2019s shared with other federal agencies to prevent erroneous benefits and sold to credit reporting companies to guard against fraud.","Sometimes the Social Security Administration prematurely declares people dead, as recentlyreportedon CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, causing bureaucratic nightmares when those people try to open bank accounts or do myriad other things requiring a valid Social Security number. The agency\u2019s internal auditor found in 2008 that 20,000 people had been wrongly listed as dead.","And sometimes the opposite is true, O'Carroll said in his testimony, and the agency fails to take away Social Security numbers from the dead -- even when  the agency has been informed of the deaths.","It all came to a head a few years ago when O'Carroll\u2019s office learned that a bank reported that a man had opened accounts using the Social Security numbers of two different people -- one born in 1886 and the other in 1893. The auditors did a little research and found that the world\u2019s oldest living man at the time was 112. So they chose the age as the entry point of their investigation.","The auditors indeed found, as Warner claimed, that 6.5 million cardholders were listed in Social Security records as being at least 112. All but about 100,000 of the numbers were issued prior to 1972, when the agency started using electronic records.","The good news is that the auditors found no instances of people illegally collecting Social Security through one of these old numbers. The bad news is that the potential for abuse is high and, according to the report, \"thousands\" of the numbers \"could have been used\" to commit other types of identity fraud.","Auditors found that 66,920 of the numbers had been used by people for whom the government received wage reports from 2006 and 2011. One of the numbers appeared on 613 different wage reports.","That means people were using the numbers in job applications and 3,873 of the numbers turned up in E-Verify inquiries, an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine whether potential hirees are entitled by immigration laws to work in the U.S.","Final notes: If you\u2019re wondering, the verified oldest person in the world at this writing isJeralean Talleyof Michigan, whose 116th birthday is on May 23.

It\u2019s a claim Democrats have continued to make against Ernst.","Both Republicans and Democrats blocked interim economic relief packages proposed by the other party in April before the final half-a-trillion-dollar package cleared the Senate. The Republicans\u2019 proposal would\u2019ve solely funded the quickly depleted Paycheck Protection Program, a loan program created by theCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Actand launched April 4 for businesses that keep employees on their payroll. Democrats pushed for a $500-billion-dollar-plus aid package with Paycheck Protection Program funds as well as$100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local government, of which some of the hospital funds made it into the final deal.","Iowa Democratic Party Communications Director Jeremy Busch referred in an interview with The Daily Iowan to a series of interviews and public statements Ernst made in April as proof her tune had changed on the expanded relief funding.","As negotiations on refilling the Paycheck Protection Program were ongoing, Ernst saidin an April 16 Fox News interviewshe supported the program and disagreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Congress should wait.","\"We have small businesses that desperately need this funding to keep their employees on payroll. If they can't do that, those employees will go unemployed and that is not the route. So, I do believe that what we had was a narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP, but the Democrats wanted to hijack it with unrelated items and additional changes. We have a program that's working, now we need to make sure that it's properly funded.\"","In an email to the Daily Iowan's PolitiFact Iowa, Ernst\u2019s spokesperson, Brendan Conley, wrote that Ernst\u2019s comment on \"unrelated items and additional changes\" referred to an early House version of what eventually became the CARES Act, the third relief bill. The version Conley referred to was noted in a March 23 article inthe Hill; it didn\u2019t clear the Senate but included funding to curb airline pollution. However, the Paycheck Protection Program launched after that article, onApril 3, as part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, making it unlikely that the narrowly crafted bill to replenish the funds for PPP referred to the measure that created the loan program.","The proposal that better fits what Ernst is describing in the Fox News interview would\u2019ve bumped up funding for the Paycheck Protection Program. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky,asked senators on April 9to approve with unanimous consent a measure that would have added $250 million in federal funds to the Paycheck Protection Program. He argued on the Senate floor that the small business loan program's funds were running out and that negotiations for hospital, local government, and test funding should be part of a separate congressional package at a later date. The reason: the extra funding wouldn\u2019t pass unanimously, he said.","However, McConnell\u2019s measure did not receive unanimous consent, as two Democrats voiced opposition. No formal recorded vote was taken to gauge Senate support for the initial proposal, so there's no formal record of Ernst's support or opposition to that measure.","Minutes after the two Democratic senators from Maryland rejected McConnell\u2019s ask to fast-track the measure, the pair proposed their own amendment which was double the dollar figure of McConnell\u2019s. It included $100 billion for hospitals dealing with COVID-19 and $150 billion for state and local governments.","A finalproposalto McConnell\u2019s original interim bill included $500 billion for hospitals, the Paycheck Protection Program and COVID-19 testing, but none for local government. The Senateapprovedthat measure April 21 with unanimous consent, a procedural fast-tracking move that means no senators voiced opposition. Again, the Senate didn\u2019t record a vote tally, but Conley wrote to the DI in an email that Ernst supported that half-a-trillion-dollar bill.","A day before the final proposal was approved in the Senate, Ernst said in an April 20 town hall, that she supported the $3.5 coronavirus relief bill\u2019s extra $75 billion to reimburse health-care providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 diagnostic testing.","\"We will also get the additional dollars we wanted for diagnostic testing an additional $25 billion there as well as another $75 billion for our hospitals. And again this is something that I\u2019ve pushed for because we want to make sure that our rural hospitals are sustaining through this COVID-19 pandemic,\"Ernst said.","Conley wrote in an April 24 email to the Daily Iowan:","\"Sen. Ernst fully supports the additional funding for hospitals and testing \u2014 which are very much related to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 as she reiterated on Monday (April 20), and that's exactly why she supported the bill that passed the Senate this week. Her voting record shows, in no uncertain terms, that she supports those measures.\"","In other statements as well before the final interim package passed, Ernst reiterated her support for a narrower agreement.","According to aRadioIowareport, Ernst said April 16 that discussions about extra funding for hospitals and local governments could wait until Congress passed the PPP funds.","\"No political gimmicks, just a simple ask to put more money in this program,\" RadioIowa reported Ernst saying. \"Unfortunately, politics got in the way.\"","In a statement from Ernst\u2019s officeApril 9, the day Democrats and Republicans rejected each others\u2019 interim relief plans, Ernst criticized Democrats for rejecting Republicans\u2019 proposal, stating that passing small business loan relief funds was too urgent to delay.","\"After hearing from Iowans and seeing the overwhelming response of small businesses across the country, it\u2019s clear we need to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program. We don\u2019t have time for political games; we\u2019re in a crisis. Workers and employers in Iowa and across the country need this relief now more than ever, so let\u2019s put aside the politics and swiftly get this specific additional support for small businesses approved so money can keep flowing, Iowa workers can continue to collect a paycheck, and our state\u2019s small businesses can stay afloat,\" Ernst said.","Congress put $350 billion toward the PPP at it's creation. The program stopped taking applications when the funds ran dry April 16 date, and resumed taking applicationsApril 27.","The interim package was one of several COVID-19 relief packages Congress has passed."]}

Judges in North Carolina are selected through partisan elections.","The constitutional amendment, if it passes, would lead to the creation of a Nonpartisan Judicial Merit Commission of no more than nine members. The members of the commission would be picked by the governor, the General Assembly and the state\u2019s chief justice. The commission would verify that all candidates who apply are legally qualified and assess their merit, without regard for party affiliation.

Not really.","What other states do","When PolitiFact reached out to Moore\u2019s office, spokesperson Joseph Kyzer cited aBallotpedia pagethat says \"34 states and the District of Columbia use some variation of assisted appointment.\" The Ballotpedia information includes all states that use a merit commission in some form, including for first-term appointments, judicial vacancies or in combination with other methods.","According todata from the New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice, most states do actually have some type of merit commission in place to help select judges.","When filling a state Supreme Court vacancy, 34 states do use some type of merit nominating commission during the process according to the data from the Brennan Center.","Only seven states currently allow the governor to directly fill state Supreme Court vacancies: Alabama, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas and Washington.","When filling vacancies in state appellate courts, the Brennan Center reports, 23 states use a nominating commission. Meanwhile, 34 states use nominating commissions to fill vacant judgeships in trial courts.","Types of merit selection","It sounds as if most states do have some type of merit nominating commission, although there are a few differences in how they operate.","Missouri was thefirst state to have a merit commission in 1940. Its setup is often regarded as the \"gold standard\" merit commission plan. The Missouri State Bar, Governor and Supreme Court have an equal share in choosing commission members. Those members then elect who the head of the commission will be.

He said because of that the term \"merit commission\" can be misleading by suggesting that a third party is involved in selecting judges.","In the proposed North Carolina commission, the General Assembly, Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court would select the commission members. The state\u2019s current Chief Justice is Mark Martin, a Republican. He was elected in 2014 for an eight year term.","According to informationfrom the nonpartisan American Judicature Society, seven states give their legislature some type of role in appointing commission members.","An NC nominating commission","That\u2019s not the only major difference between the proposed North Carolina commission and other commissions.","In the proposed amendment, the role of the commission would be to make sure the candidates are qualified to fill judicial vacancies, as prescribed by the law, without regard to their party affiliation. The commission\u2019s evaluation would then be sent to the General Assembly, who will choose at least two candidates for the governor to choose from.","\"The nominating commission is only tasked with determining if the applicants meet the legal qualifications to be a judge, which is different than how nominating commissions are used in other states,\" said Douglas Keith, counsel in the Democracy program for the New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice.","Stephen Ware, a law professor at the University of Kansas, says that, based on the description in the ballot, the merit commission would play a less powerful role than in other states if its objective is to check \"legal requirements as opposed to assessing the pros and cons of applicants and making the hard choices of who would be better.\"","In fact, most merit commissions are tasked with \"narrowing down a pool of applicants to a few finalists\" for the governor or legislature to select from says Ware.","Our ruling"]}

We also looked at Trump\u2019s overall views on nuclear policy.","\u2018I love war in a certain way.\u2019","This comment comes from a 90-minute speech inIowa on Nov. 12, 2015. In the speech, Trump theorized that former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein feigned having weapons of mass destruction to scare neighboring Iran, before briefly sidetracking into his feelings on war generally.","\"This is the Trump theory on war,\" he said. \"But I'm good at war. I've had a lot of wars of my own.I'm really good at war. I love war in a certain way.But only when we win.\"","He then moved on to talking about veterans. Earlier in his speech, he railed against the decision to invade Iraq.","\u2018Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\u2019","Trump made his comments about \"nukes\" in anApril 3 interviewwithFox News Sunday\u2019s Chris Wallace. Wallace was asking Trump abouthis suggestionthat Japan might be better off with nuclear weapons.","Wallace: \"You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?\"","Trump: \"In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.\"","Wallace: \"Understood.\"","Trump: \"It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea.\"","Wallace: \"With nukes?\"","Trump: \"Maybe they would be better off \u2014including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.\"","So Trump was saying Japan might do well to defend itself with its own nuclear weapons, rather than talking about what he would do as president with the United States\u2019 own nuclear arsenal.","The way the ad splices Trump's comments together, a reasonable person would think Trump \"loves war,\" including \"with nukes.\"","Priorities USA spokesman Justin Barasky told us that the fact Trump is open to more countries having nuclear weapons supports the ad\u2019s overarching argument \u2014 that Trump would be too dangerous.","Other comments","Trump has offered somewhat conflicting views on using nuclear weapons throughout the campaign.","He has said he \"wouldn\u2019t rule out\" using tactical nuclear weapons against ISIS, but adding in thesame interview: \"Definitely nuclear weapons are a last resort.\"","Nor would he rule out using nuclear weapons inEurope, if a conflict ever were to arise.","\"You don\u2019t want to, say, take everything off the table,\" he said.","He also told theNew York Times, \"It\u2019s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation.\"","Our ruling"]}

But cases are rising sharply among adolescents as the delta variant spreads across the country.","Nationally, nearly 94,000 child cases of COVID-19 were recorded for the week ending Aug. 5, up from 72,000 cases the week before and up from 39,000 two weeks earlier,NPR reported, based on data from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association.","On its website, the CDC recommends \"everyone 12 years and older should get a COVID-19 vaccination to help protect against COVID-19.\" It describes the vaccine assafeandeffective, and a critical tool to help stop the pandemic.","Timetable For COVID-19 Vaccine For Children Under 12","We also looked at Elder\u2019s claim that he doesn\u2019t \"believe the science suggests\" young people should be vaccinated in the context of children under 12. For this group, we found the examination of vaccine data isn\u2019t complete, but no indication that vaccines will be unsafe for these younger children once authorized.","As many parents of young children know, the COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been authorized for kids under 12 because the FDA is still collecting data to evaluate vaccine safety and effectiveness for these age groups.","In July, the FDA expanded vaccine trials for children under 12 \"to more closely examine rare but serious instances, particularly in young boys, in which the heart muscle becomes inflamed,\" or myocarditis, theWashington Post reported.

Elder\u2019s claim that the science suggests young people shouldn\u2019t receive the vaccine is not supported.","In May, theFDA approved the COVID-19 vaccinefor children ages 12 to 15 on an emergency use basis.

But asPolitiFact reported in June, that\u2019s not because the WHO takes issue with its safety or effectiveness.","Instead, the WHO believes health care workers, front-line workers, the elderly and those with high-risk medical conditions should be at the front of the line because children develop less severe cases than adults and vaccine supplies are limited in many countries.","The Science On Wearing Masks At Schools","We also examined Elder\u2019s claim that young people shouldn\u2019t have to wear masks because the science isn\u2019t \"settled\" on that. Again, we found the science is more certain than Elder makes it out to be.","Leading scientific organizations, including theCDCandAAP, recommend students wear masks at schools, saying they reduce the spread of COVID-19.","On its website, the CDC recommends \"universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status.\"","It describes mask use as one of several ways to reduce transmission in schools, along with ventilation, hand-washing and physical distancing.","\"Although outbreaks in schools can occur, multiple studies have shown that transmission within school settings is typically lower than \u2013 or at least similar to \u2013 levels of community transmission, when prevention strategies are in place in schools,\" theCDC reported in July, adding that inconsistent mask use can contribute to outbreaks.","Since the start of the pandemic, PolitiFact hasexamined the sciencebehind using masks to slow transmission and debunked myths about them. It\u2019s found masks aremost effectiveas \"source control,\" which means preventing infected people from spreading the virus to other people.","Now that students are back on campus in California and across the country, health officials say vaccines and universal mask requirements will be key to keeping in-person learning safe and open.","\"Masking is likely the second most important thing [behind vaccinations] to prevent transmission and allow children to go to schools and have in-person learning safely,\" said Dr. Dean Blumberg, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UC Davis Children\u2019s Hospital in Sacramento.","Blumberg added that wearing a standard surgical mask or double layer fabric mask reduces a person\u2019s chance of infection by about 70%.","\"If you want to avoid having that outbreak that's going to send all the kids home again, you should be doing everything to avoid that. And that means wearing masks,\" Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, added inthe NPR interview.","In July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s administrationissued guidancecalling for universal masking at K-12 public schools statewide.

Phil Scott, who said it created an\"unprecedented\" level of liabilityfor Vermont businesses.","During a House floor debate on the bill last week, Rep. Scott Beck, R-St. Johnsbury,introduced an amendment to S.37favored by industry representatives that sets more stringent criteria for people in an exposed area to receive medical monitoring.","Multiple lawmakers rose to speak in favor of the amendment. Rep. Heidi Scheuermann, R-Stowe, said representatives from the manufacturing industry \"came to Montpelier this year\" with the intent of supporting medical monitoring legislation.","\"They understand the importance (of medical monitoring),\" she said on the House floor last Thursday, referring to industry. \"It\u2019s clear, though, that they want to do it in a way that is consistent with other states and S.37 just isn\u2019t.\"","Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, and Sen. Bobby Starr, D-Essex-Orleans, echoed similar concerns during Senate floor debate on the bill this week.","The bill passed both the House and the Senate, but is unlikely to get the governor's signature.","So we were wondering, if S.37 becomes law, would Vermont be an outlier compared to the rest of the country?","In an interview Wednesday, Scheuermann said that her statement came from concerns expressed by industry representatives and lobbyists. In particular, they felt the so-called \"test\" for medical monitoring in S.37 was too lenient and would impact their ability to obtain insurance, she said.","\"GlobalFoundries testified, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce testified, (Associated Industries of Vermont) testified, all pointing out the specifics of how it is out of line with other states and what that impact could be to manufacturers in our state and their ability to obtain liability insurance,\" she said.","Scheuermann also directed VTDigger to astate-by-state comparisonof medical monitoring from Jill Rickard, director of policy at the state Department of Financial Regulation.","In Rickard\u2019s comparison, five of the six states and territories referenced \u2014 Guam, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Florida \u2014 require plaintiffs demonstrate either significant exposure to a toxic substance or exposure greater than background levels. Courts in Guam, Florida and Pennsylvania all say that the plaintiff must have a \"significantly\" increased risk of contracting a \"serious\" latent disease.","Beck\u2019s amendment would have required exposure to a toxic substance be \"significant.\" It also would have changed \"greater risk of contracting a latent disease\" to a \"significantly increased risk of contracting a serious latent disease.\"","The argument between industry representative and environmental advocates on the latest version centers on whether or not to include those adjectives in the medical monitoring test in S.37.","There is little disagreement that if S.37 is signed by Gov. Phil Scott, Vermont would be the first state in the country to put the right to sue for medical monitoring into state law, and not leave the decision only to a court. So far, courts in 16 states have recognized medical monitoring claims, while 13 states have denied those claims, arguing a medical condition must arise first, according to awhite paperby Ken Rumelt, a professor at Vermont Law School.","This week, 38 industry associations around the state sent a letter to senators, urging them to vote against the bill.","\"The major flaw with this legislation is that it is not consistent with what courts in other states have held regarding medical monitoring claims,\" the groups wrote in the letter. \"This will increase operational risks and costs for a wide range of Vermont employers, and make Vermont an outlier even compared to other states that have recognized this as a remedy for plaintiffs.\"","State and federal courts in nine jurisdictions include the requirement that the plaintiff show they are at a \"significantly increased risk\" of developing a \"serious\" disease, according to a handout from an industry lobbyist. And courts in seven jurisdictions require the plaintiff to show that exposure was either \"significant\" or \"above background levels.\"","But proponents of the bill argue that the test for medical monitoring in S.37 is not that different than in other jurisdictions.","\"Despite what you have heard, the test for medical monitoring in S.37 is not materially different than the test that exists in other states,\" wrote Jon Groveman, policy and water program director for Vermont Natural Resources Council, and Ken Rumelt, senior attorney at Vermont Law School, intestimonyat the end of April.","They go on to write that, in some ways, the bill would set \"more stringent\" conditions for medical monitoring claims than other states. For example, no other states have limited medical monitoring claims to large facilities or specific industries like in S.37.","Groveman and Rumelt also reference acase pending in federal courtbrought by Bennington residents exposed to PFOA seeking medical monitoring costs, among other damages. Judge Geoffrey Crawford issued a preliminary ruling in the ongoing Bennington case that lays out a less strict test than in S.37, they say.","In a white paper he prepared for Vermont Natural Resources Council and VPIRG, Rumelt describes the \"high bar\" plaintiffs must prove to qualify for medical monitoring from West Virginia\u2019s Bower case. Under that eight-part test, plaintiffs must show they\u2019ve been \"significantly exposed\" to a proven hazardous substance, putting them at an increased risk for developing a \"serious latent disease.\"","\"I think it\u2019s, to a large degree, equivalent to the Bower\u2019s test,\" Rumelt said of S.37.","In the Bower case, \"significant exposure\" is defined as the plaintiff being exposed to a hazardous substance.","Rumelt and other proponents of the bill say that the requirement in S.37 that a physician has to testify that a plaintiff\u2019s exposure would make additional testing beyond what is generally prescribed \"reasonably necessary\" speaks to the significance of exposure and seriousness of disease.","In an email, Groveman listed tests for medical monitoring in some of the states where courts have allowed it. California does require a plaintiff to show the \"significance and extent of exposure\" and the \"seriousness of diseases for which the plaintiff is at an increased risk,\" but  does not require the plaintiff to show that he or she is at a seriously increased risk.","In Utah, the plaintiff must show that exposure puts them at risk of developing a \"serious disease, illness or injury\" but not that there was significant exposure or a significantly increased risk. In Missouri, there is not a list of elements, but the court allowed a claim when a plaintiff has a \"significantly increased risk of contracting a particular disease relative to what would be the case in the absence of exposure.\"","And in New York, courts are all over the map in whether or not they recognize medical monitoring claims.","In a class action case ruling involving the National Hockey League Players\u2019 Concussion Injury Litigation, the U.S. District Court of Minnesota reviewed medical monitoring common law throughout the country. The plaintiffs had sought to group together 28 jurisdictions that they claim allow medical monitoring.","\"Plaintiffs\u2019 grouping theory cannot be used to sidestep the widespread divergence among the states in the requirements for medical monitoring,\" Judge Susan Richard Nelson writes.","In her conclusion, Nelson cites \"widespread differences in the applicable state laws governing medical monitoring\" as a reason not to grant class certification to the plaintiffs."]}

He did, however, dismiss the research that cast doubt on whether the drug does any good against COVID-19.","\"If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\" Trump said at aMay 19press event. \"They were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.\"","Later that day, Trump clarified that he was talking about a study of Veterans Administration patients.","Trump spoke as if there were only one negative study. There have been three: the one on VA patients and two larger ones. They all reached the same conclusion that outcomes with hydroxychloroquine were the same as without it.","Theearliest workon hydroxychloroquine was small studies, sometimes with as few as 30 patients, and for each study that showed promise, another study found no benefit. The mixed results spurred more research.","The analysis Trump criticized came in late April, when researchers at theuniversities of South Carolina and Virginiareleased their paper on 368 VA patients with COVID-19. They looked at who got hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or both, and they tracked who ended up on a ventilator or died. The paper was released without peer review.","They found that hydroxychloroquine, with or without the other drug, had no effect on whether someone had to be put on a ventilator. Worse, hydroxychloroquine increased the chances of dying.","The authors cautioned that all of the patients involved in the study, regardless of outcome, were men over 65. And they also factored in a range of underlying conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and other health risks. Those issues were found in roughly equal numbers across all groups of patients. Ultimately, about 75% of the patients getting hydroxychloroquine lived. The survival rate was close to 90% for those who didn\u2019t get it.","In early May, two studies emerged based on patients treated in the nation\u2019s biggest COVID-19 hotspot, New York City. Both investigations were much larger than the study of VA patients.","The study that appeared May 7 in theNew England Journal of Medicinelooked at the medical records of 1,376 people who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital. Their results echoed the first study on hydroxychloroquine.","\"There was no association between administration of the drug and a lower chance of dying or winding up on a respirator,\" said co-author Neil Schluger, the head of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.","Now, it\u2019s fair to say that the patients who got the drug were, as a group, a bit worse off than those who didn\u2019t. In particular, their blood oxygen levels were lower when they were first admitted. Schluger said that didn\u2019t matter.","\"The difference in oxygen levels between the two groups we compared were fairly small and not clinically important,\" Schluger said.","These patients were not close to death, Schluger said.","\"Overall, about 83% of the patients in our cohort survived, and that survival had no association with hydroxychloroquine administration,\" he said.","On May 11, the JAMA Network of theJournal of the American Medical Associationpublished a study of 1,438 randomly selected COVID-19 patients treated at 25 New York area hospitals. That group of researchers tracked whether they died in the hospital. They, too, found no connection between outcomes and use of hydroxychloroquine. They also found no impact from the use of another drug, azithromycin. About 75% of patients getting hydroxychloroquine survived, compared with about 87% who were not given the drug.","Like the other study, this one found that patients who got the drug were in worse health at admission than those who didn\u2019t. They might have lower oxygen levels, or some other condition such as diabetes or obesity.","But by examining patients\u2019 full medical records, both teams were able to use stronger analytic tools to filter out the impact of differences in underlying health. Once that was done, they could make apples-to-apples comparisons of the effect of hydroxychloroquine on people who got the drug and those who didn\u2019t.","The authors of all studies acknowledged that working with patient records after the fact isn\u2019t the final answer, and they called for more research.","We reached out to the White House and did not hear back."]}

But when a black driver was stopped, the search rate was significantly higher \u2014 12 percent \u2014 and the odds of actually finding contraband were significantly lower (22 percent).","Not only that, blacks were twice as likely as whites to be arrested during a traffic stop.","In a spot check,we found similar patterns inJefferson City.","It's not just traffic stops. According to a National Research Council report,drug arrest rateshave long been higher for blacks, even though data show that blacks are generally no more likely to use drugs than whites and there's little evidence that they sell drugs more often than whites.","What surveys have shown \"is that the levels of self-reported drug sales are about the same for blacks and whites, especially under age 20,\" said Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"But the big differences are that whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors.

When judges have discretion over how long a sentence should be for a specific crime, they tend to select longer sentences for blacks even if they have the same criminal history.","After controlling for the arrest offense, a person's criminal history and other characteristics, sentences for black males were about 10 percent higher than for whites, the study found.","The problem is that as cases work their way through the various steps of the criminal justice system, the degree of the disparity \"accumulates at each level,\" said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a research analyst at the Sentencing Project.","\"You're a little bit more likely to get arrested if you're a person of color than if you're white. You're a little bit more likely to have a higher bail amount to be released. That's going to make it harder for you to get released. You're a little more likely to get a worse plea deal offer,\" she said. \"As you go through the system, each individual stage makes some small contribution to the overall disparity that we see. But it's going to be significant as you go through the stages.\"","Tonry of the University of Minnesota agreed that sentences are longer for blacks generally, but \"it depends hugely on what crime you're talking about.","\"If it's a drug crime that's affected by mandatory minimums, it's vastly longer,\" Tonry said. \"If you're talking about things not subject to mandatory minimums, on average, across the board, blacks probably get sentences that are 5 percent or 10 percent longer than whites do.\"","How much of this is due to racism is a matter of debate. The experts say poverty may play a major role, but it can be hard to separate the two. The best studies try to adjust for the fact that minorities tend to be concentrated in poorer areas, where crime tends to be higher and there's a greater demand for police.

The saliva tests would enable police to determine when drivers have the drug in their system. \"If the experiences in Colorado and Washington are the experiences we have here, roadway deaths are going to go up, impaired driving is likely to go up,\"Anderson said.","A number of readers told us Anderson was off the mark. So we decided to find out: Have legal recreational cannabis markets in Colorado and Washington led to a rise in roadway deaths and impaired driving rates?","We reached out to the Department of Public Safety and asked for sources backing up the commissioner's claim.","In response, the department sent seven sources -- including five studies and two news articles from theDenver Postand theBellingham Herald. The sources all show that rates of impaired driving and roadway fatalities have increased since cannabis was legalized.","However, even that data is contradictory. None of the sources have proven the increase was caused by the legalization of recreational cannabis markets alone, which was the point that Anderson seemed to be making.","It\u2019s also important to note that no accurate roadside testing for cannabis impairment currently exists. At this point, law enforcement typically use blood tests to determine whether drivers have THC in their system. The drug, however, can remain in someone\u2019s blood for weeks, making it difficult to determine the time at which someone is actually under the influence.","Recreational cannabis has been legal in Washington and Colorado since 2012. Recreational stores opened in 2014.","A study by the Foundation for Traffic Safetyreported in 2016that an estimated 303 drivers \u2014 10 percent of all drivers involved in fatal crashes in Washington between 2010 and 2014 \u2014 had detectable tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, in their blood at or shortly after the time of a crash.","The number of drivers who tested positive for THC remained steady before and immediately after legalization took effect, according to the study.","But researchers found that about nine months after cannabis was legally available for purchase, the number of drugged driving citations began increasing at a rate of almost 10 percentage points per year. It is unclear whether the increase was caused by the legalization of cannabis or by factors \"that were beyond the scope of the study.\"","A study by the Colorado Department of Transportation published in August 2018 reported that overall, the number of fatalities involving drivers who tested positive for cannabis has nearly doubled since recreational legalization in 2014 -- from 75 that year to 125 in 2016 and 139 in 2017.","However, in spite of cannabis-related driving fatalities going up, in the first quarter of 2017, the number of cannabis-related DUIs dropped by 33 percent from the same period in 2016, according to Colorado State Patrol. From January until March in 2017, 155 people received citations for cannabis impairment while driving, compared to 232 people in 2016.","The Colorado study does not point to legalization as the cause of the increase in cannabis impaired driving.","Another study last year, conducted by researchers at the University of Oregon, explicitly stated that the argument that legal cannabis has led to a spike in traffic deaths and impaired driving is misleading. The upward trend in cannabis-related fatalities in Colorado, and to some extent in Washington, would have taken place whether or not recreational cannabis was legalized, the authors say.","Some research clearly supports the claim that traffic accidents are on the rise in states that have legalized cannabis, but the reason behind why it is happening remains unclear to researchers.","A study released in October by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), estimated that the rate of car crashes rose a combined 6 percent following the start of retail sales of recreational cannabis in Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington."]}

He would almost certainly have been in line to receive it even if he had taken a different job, as long as it wasn\u2019t with an Exxon Mobil competitor.","For a statement that has an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False."],"full_article":["In moving from CEO of Exxon Mobil to Secretary of State,Rex Tillersonis getting $180 million from his former company.","But is the payment a \"government service golden parachute\" that Tillerson would not get had he taken a different job?","That\u2019s the allegation from U.S. Sen.Tammy Baldwin, who hasrailed againstpeople who cash in by moving from the private sector into government jobs.","Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat whofaces re-electionin 2018, made her attackon the Senate flooron Jan. 31, 2017, the day before Tillerson was sworn in as President Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Baldwin referred to President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and a bill she said was aimed at \"slowing the revolving door\" in Washington, then said:","\"I was inspired to introduce this legislation when I saw several Obama administration appointees receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for leaving their private-sector jobs to join the government. These \u2018government service golden parachutes,\u2019 as they are known, demonstrate how valuable some companies believe it is to have friends in high places.\"","Tillerson, she continued, \"received a $180 million payout from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere.\"","What we found is that Baldwin is right on the figure. But the payment is a retirement benefit that Tillerson earned after more than 40 years with the company, not extra compensation conditioned on joining the government a few months before reaching the company\u2019s mandatory retirement age.","Indeed, experts told us, he likely only risked losing the $180 million had he gone to work for an Exxon Mobil competitor.","The money -- yes","There was no government requirement,PolitiFact New York found, for Tillerson to divest from his Exxon Mobil stock. But had he kept the stock, he would have had to recuse himself of any State Department business related to the company, or take other steps to avoid a conflict of interest.","An agreementhe made with Exxon Mobil -- the one that drew Baldwin\u2019s attack -- is aimed at avoiding the conflict of interest.","TheWall Street Journal, theLos Angeles Times,The Guardianandothernewsorganizations reported onan announcementof the agreement, as well asa filingwith the federal Securities and Exchange Commission that Exxon Mobil made on Jan. 4, 2017. That was a few days after Tillerson\u2019s retirement and a week before hisSenate confirmation hearing.","Tillerson had been set to receive roughly $180 million in Exxon Mobil shares that would have vested over a decade following hisretirement, which was expected to be in March 2017, when he turns 65.","Instead, Exxon essentially\"cashed out\"Tillerson. Under the agreement, the shares were transferred to an independently managed trust, which will pay Tillerson the $180 million over the same 10-year schedule. The deal amounts to about$7 million lessthan the compensation package that he would have received if he had not been tapped for the post, the Wall Street Journal noted.","\u2018Golden parachute\u2019 -- no","Now let\u2019s turn to Baldwin\u2019s larger point -- that the payment is a \"government service golden parachute\" Tillerson would not get if \"had he taken a job elsewhere.\"","Baldwin\u2019s office sent us information, but no one replied to our requests to speak to someone in the office. The office suggested we contactJeff Hauser, who is executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C..","Hauser argued that Exxon Mobil gave \"special dispensation\" to Tillerson by cashing him out on the stock that otherwise would have taken 10 years to vest. He noted that the company\u2019s policy states that executives risk losing long-term equity awards by retiring early.","But the policy also allows for the company to decide that the executive can keep the awards, which is what it did in making the $180 million agreement.","Rosanna Landis Weaver, executive compensation project manager for Oakland, Calif.-based As You Sow, a national group that advocates for shareholders,also criticizedExxon Mobil for not sticking to its usual practice of long-term vesting. She told us she expects the cash payout to the trust, rather than receiving the stock over time, will benefit Tillerson financially, though she acknowledged that\u2019s an open question.","But Baldwin\u2019s statement isn\u2019t about the impact of Tillerson\u2019s deal on Exxon Mobil stockholders and the $180 million doesn\u2019t come as a result of Tillerson taking the secretary of state job.","\"It doesn't appear to be a reward specifically for going into government service, but rather a standard agreement in which he gets the payout as long as he does not work in the (oil) industry for 10 years,\" said Ari Goldberg, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-basedProject On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog.","A \"golden parachute\" typically refers to severance payments executives get after their companiesare acquiredor made part of a merger. Indeed, thefederal tax coderefers to parachute payments as compensation paid as a result of achange in controlof a company. But the payment Tillerson is getting isn\u2019t something extra. It\u2019s a retirement benefit he had earned.","\"Tillerson is clearly getting a large cash settlement, but this reflects payments for services earned over the prior many years, and not a cash reward or \u2018parachute\u2019 tied to his resignation,\" said executive compensation expertKevin Murphy, a finance and business economics professor at the University of Southern California.","We\u2019ll note that Baldwin used the lesser known term \"government service golden parachute.\" But that typically is used by groups such as the AFL-CIO union inreference to Wall Street. It refers to financial incentives Wall Street firms give to senior executives who take government jobs. The concern is whether the companies then expect favorable government treatment from their former executives.","Others referto government-based golden parachutes provided by Wall Street banks as accelerated vesting of equity-based awards for senior executives who resign voluntarily to enter government service -- in other words, compensation that they would otherwise forfeit for failing to meet normal vesting requirements. That\u2019s more similar to Tillerson\u2019s situation.","But Murphy and another executive compensation expertSteven Balsam, told us it\u2019s highly unlikely that Tillerson would have lost out on his retirement benefits, a few months before reaching the mandatory retirement age, simply by taking another job -- unless it was with an Exxon Mobil competitor.","\"This terms of his retirement\/separation were agreed upon prior to his being nominated to be secretary of state. He\u2019s not getting it because he took the (secretary of state) job,\" said Balsam,  a business professor at Temple University in Philadelphia.","Our rating"]}

We didn\u2019t get anything from him right away.","So we did our own research and found that Virginia is the only other state to require students to receive immunization for HPV. Virginia\u2019s vaccination requirement, which is only for sixth-grade girls, took effect in 2008 following an act of the legislature.","Rhode Island\u2019s policy is the product of a regulatory process that began in 2013 under the leadership of Michael Fine, then the state\u2019s director of the Department of Health.","In both states, HPV vaccination policies use the word \"required\" and both have opt-out provisions. In Virginia,  parents have \"sole discretion\" on whether their children receive the vaccination.","Stenhouse labels the policies in Virginia and Rhode Island as mandates. But Jason L. Schwartz, an assistant professor at the Yale University School of Public Health, says you can\u2019t call policies with such liberal exemptions mandates.","The breadth of Rhode Island\u2019s opt-out provisions may not have been clear to the  public \u2014 or to Stenhouse \u2014 before a public meeting Aug. 5. That\u2019s when Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott, the new director of the Department of Health, told parents that their philosophical objections would qualify for the religious exemption spelled out in the regulations.","But what about the center\u2019s claim that Rhode Island imposed the requirement by \"regulatory fiat, without public debate, and without consideration from the elected representatives of the people\"?","And, as the center says later in its policy statement, was the health department\u2019s decision an example of \"regulatory despotism\" that \"bypasses the traditional democratic process\"?","While it\u2019s true that the General Assembly did not pass a law for the HPV vaccination, existing Rhode Island law gives the health director the power to adopt regulations to protect public health. And, of course, the health director is appointed by, and serves at the pleasure of, the governor.","Further, control of health-care policyby the executive branch is common in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for example, makes decisions affecting the health welfare of the country without first getting an act of Congress.","\"To say it\u2019s anti-democratic would be a misunderstanding of how we structure our government in the United States,\" says Schwartz, the Yale professor, who co-authored a recent article about state vaccination requirements for the Journal of the American Medical Association.","Also it\u2019s not as if the state adopted the regulation in a back room somewhere \u2014 even though Stenhouse\u2019s organizationon July 30 described the news of the requirement as a \"stunning revelation.\"","On Dec. 2, 2013, Fine, the former health director, filed a notice of public hearing for Jan. 16, 2014, and also solicited written statements on the issue. In response to criticism, the department delayed the beginning of the program from Aug. 1, 2014, to Aug. 1, 2015, according to a form for the regulation that was filed with the Office of Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea.","The Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union registered its ardent opposition to the proposed regulation at the hearing and in written comments. On Jan. 27, 2014, the ACLU called on the health department to reconsider the proposal. The ACLU also criticized the requirement on Facebook.","That\u2019s seems like debate to us.","We tried to get Stenhouse to explain what the center meant by the phrase \"regulatory fiat.\" He declined. Instead, he sent us a written statement in which he said the center \"stands by its statement\" and he challenged PolitiFact\u2019s fairness and objectivity.","Our ruling"]}

They established a framework agreement that lays the foundations for a final deal, to be reached in the summer. So we wondered: Are the United States and Iran\u2019s descriptions of what the deal will entail so different?","It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, was a framework, not a final deal. The framework itself isn\u2019t publicly available, and the parties still have plenty of details to hammer out. For these reasons, there\u2019s room for the negotiating parties to fill in the blanks with details that appeal to constituents.","Even so, some of the differences between the United States\u2019 and Iran\u2019s descriptions of the agreement are significant -- such as the timeline for sanctions relief and how much access international inspectors will have to Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.","Back in April, Iran and the United States decided to set these differences aside, hoping to successfully address them later, said Matthew Kroenig, a professor at Georgetown University and an expert in nuclear weapons policy.","\"These differences are important, however, and could very well kill the deal,\" Kroenig said.","Officials in both countries have said the other\u2019s descriptions run counter to what was decided in Lausanne, and if they can\u2019t agree, the potential for a deal might die.","Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Javad Zarif tweeted and said on Iranian television that the American factsheet was \"in contradiction\" to the framework agreement,according totheNew York Times.","Responding to a question about Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s pushback against the deal,Obama told reporters April 11, \"If that is his understanding and his position -- in ways that can't be squared with our concern about being able to embark on vigorous inspections to assure that Iran isn't cheating under any program, and that we don't have the capacity to snap back sanctions when we see a potential violation -- then we're probably not going to get a deal.\"","Significant discrepancies","We reached out to Rubio\u2019s team and didn\u2019t hear back. But Iran and the United States have each produced factsheets about the agreement, in addition to a joint statement from the negotiating parties. If you want to look at the details yourself, Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs put together aside-by-side comparison of all three fact sheetsand relevant political statements.","A major discrepancy between Iran and the United States is the timeline and conditions for pulling back sanctions against Iran.","According to the American factsheet, the United States and European Union will \"suspend\" sanctions against Iran after it has been verified that Iran is complying with the deal. The sanctions can \"snap back\" into place if it is discovered that Iran is not complying.","Iran\u2019s summary, on the other hand, says the sanctions will be \"revoked\" as soon as the deal is implemented -- distinguishing a permanent change from the ability to reinstate sanctions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhanisaid April 4, \"During the talks we (both sides) always talked about lifting economic, financial, and banking sanctions. We never talked about the suspension of the sanctions, and if that were the case, no agreement would form.\"","Additionally, Obama said the sanctions relief would be \"phased in,\" while Rouhani said the sanctions would be canceled on the \"very first day of the implementation of the deal.\"","Another point of contention is the level of access international inspectors will have to Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.","The American factsheet has several bullet points emphasizing that the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s inspectors will have near universal access to Iranian nuclear facilities. Obama called it \"unprecedented,\" noting that Iran will also be required to grant access to the material supply chain in addition to the facilities themselves.","Iran\u2019s summary of the framework says much less about verification processes. It says Iran will comply with some of the agency\u2019s protocols \"on a voluntary and temporary basis.\" Additionally, Iran\u2019s religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said international inspectors will not have unlimited access to nuclear facilities.","\"It must absolutely not be allowed for them to infiltrate into the country\u2019s defense and security domain under the pretext of inspections,\" Khamenei said, asreportedby theWall Street Journal.","While the discrepancies over sanctions and levels of verification are important, others are a just matter of spin, said Graham Allison, director of Harvard\u2019s Belfer Center and a nuclear weapons analyst.","For example, regarding one of Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facilities, the United States factsheet says, \"Almost two-thirds of Fordow\u2019s centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed.\" Iran\u2019s factsheet, on the other hand says, \"More than 1,000 centrifuge machines and all related infrastructure in Fordow will be preserved and maintained.\"","Both descriptions are accurate -- Fordow currently has 2,710 centrifuges, and the deal will lower that number to 1,044.","While the differences in the public descriptions may be striking, Allison said people should not pass judgment on the final deal yet, given that the real negotiations are conducted in private, meaning the real contents of the deal are private, too.","\"Poisonous political divides in both Washington and Tehran mean that a host of commentators and even journalists seize on, and even exaggerate, these differences for their own political ends,\" Allison said.","Our ruling"]}

Paul was making the point that the government never actually shut down during the so called 'shutdown,'\" a spokesman told us. \"Even though some government employees were furloughed, salaries were still paid for those who didn't work and government had to pay interest on late payments.\"","We found that this was true. The government still functioned partially during the shutdown, and furloughed employees got back pay. On top of doling out delayed payments, the government faced late payment penalties and other logistical costs associated with preparing or recuperating from two weeks of stalled activity. They also lost revenue from national parks and museums.","But a more significant and documented blow was to the economy as a whole. We found a solid consensus among economists that the shutdown was expensive to the U.S. economy in terms of actual costs and lost productivity.","The most thorough report examining the shutdown came out of Nov. 7, 2013, from theOffice of Management and Budget, which reports directly to the president. (Paul\u2019s spokesman pointed us to thisNew York Timesarticle about the White House report as evidence.)","Here\u2019s a few highlights:","$2.5 billion in compensation costs for furloughed workers (whose lack of pay for two weeks hampered consumer spending);","120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in the first half of October;","$500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed National Parks ;","$11 million in lost National Parks and Smithsonian Institution revenue;","Interest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government was unable to pay during the shutdown;","Resources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode;","1.2 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldn\u2019t be processed, causing a delay in private-sector lending and other activities;","Stalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed moving products to market.","We also found estimates from financial analytics companies in the private sector. All of these (about a dozen) showed a negative effect on the economy, though. Most of the estimates predicted that the shutdown would not affect the economy\u2019s growth path substantially. (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Servicecompiledthe reports in 2013.)","Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the shutdown stunted fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.5 points, resulting in a $20 billion hit. The shutdown disrupted federal spending, global trade and investments in housing and businesses. Additionally, in the shutdown\u2019s aftermath, consumers held back spending and foreign confidence in the American economy waned.","Standard and Poor'ssaid the shutdown took $24 billion out of the economy and reduced yearly fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.6 percent.

Mark Hanson, an IRS spokesman, told us in an email that it takes years for the agency to compile its tax-gap estimate, because it requires complicated research.","The latest figures available are for 2006. The IRS says there were nearly $2.7 trillion in total tax liabilities in 2006. Of that amount, about $450 billion wasn\u2019t paid on time. The main cause of  missed payments was taxpayers underreporting their income, the IRS said.","Some late payments eventually trickled in, and the IRS took enforcement actions against some tax scofflaws. Those actions recovered about $65 billion, according to the agency\u2019s tallies, leaving about $385 billion in liabilities the IRS says it was owed but didn\u2019t collect.","So Connolly\u2019s claim that there\u2019s \"somewhere north\" of $350 billion in taxes left on the table has validity.","Is all that tax collectible?","To complete our fact check, we also need to look at the second part of Connolly\u2019s statement - that the IRS doesn\u2019t collect the $350 billion-plus each year because it lacks \"resources.\"","Two analysts told us that extra resources could help the IRS narrow the gap, but it wouldn\u2019t completely erase tax evasion.","\"Some of it is uncollectible, people don\u2019t have the money,\" said Eric Toder, co-director of the non-partisan Tax Policy Center who has written about the tax gap.","Moreover, Toder said that certain unpaid tax liabilities are just inherently difficult to discover, such as cash transactions by small businesses that can occur without any record. More auditors would capture some unpaid taxes, Toder said, but they would provide only a few stitches in mending the tax gap.","In 2007, Toder authored apaperthat said Congress and President George W. Bush\u2019s administration could take added steps to patch the tax gap, such as providing the IRS more resources for enforcement and requiring taxpayers to report more income information. But he said policymakers had to be realistic about the return they would see on such initiatives.","\"Although estimates of how much additional resources and better enforcement tools would raise are incomplete and highly uncertain, it is extremely unlikely that they could raise more than $20-30 billion per year,\" Toder wrote.","In an interview, Toder told us there is a danger the tax gap could grow if the IRS is cut back too much and there becomes a sense that enforcement is lax due to strained resources.","We also spoke to Robert Goulder, tax policy counsel at Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based non-profit that examines tax regulations. He told us filling the gap would require unrealistic scenarios, such as an IRS agent being assigned to watch the cash register at every \"mom and pop\" small business. Added enforcement also would run counter to an American culture that chafes at inquiries from the IRS, Goulder said.","Even with an unlimited budget, Goulder said, \"they still couldn\u2019t get the tax gap down to zero.\"","A 2012 Government Accountability Officereport, which looked at various strategies to cut down the tax gap, said \"closing the entire gap may not be feasible, since it could entail more intrusive recordkeeping or reporting than the public is willing to accept or more resources than the IRS is able to commit.\" It cited a 1997 GAOreportwhich said \"it would be unrealistic to assume that our tax system, or any tax system, can achieve 100-percent compliance and thus eliminate the tax gap.\"","Our ruling"]}

But that was the position of the wider U.S. government, as well as other international institutions.","\u2022 We found no evidence to support the idea that Joe Biden advocated with his son's interests in mind, as the message suggests. It's not even clear that the company was actively under investigation or that a change in prosecutors benefited it.","Hunter Biden didhold a directorshipwith a natural gas company called Burisma Holdings, beginning in the spring of 2014.","Reutersreported at the time that a statement on the company\u2019s website said the younger Biden \"would help the company with \"transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion,\" and other issues. The company also retained the law firm where Biden had been working, Boies Schiller Flexner.","The position with Burisma came at a time when the younger Biden had joined with Christopher Heinz (the stepson of then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.) and Devon Archer (a Kerry family friend) in a string of investment and consulting firms. Firms run by Biden and Archer \"pursued business with international entities that had a stake in American foreign policy decisions, sometimes in countries where connections implied political influence and protection,\" the New York Timesreported.","Biden\u2019s Burisma directorship attracted attention because Burisma was owned by Mykola Zlochevsky, a minister under Russia-friendly President Viktor F. Yanukovych who subsequently went into exile after a popular revolution. After Yanukovych was ousted, Zlochevsky faced a variety of corruption-related investigations involving his business.","In 2015, Ukraine\u2019s newly appointed prosecutor general Viktor Shokin inherited some of the investigations into Zlochevsky and his company. (Zlochevsky and the company have denied the allegations.) Shokin was ousted as prosecutor in 2016. Shokin is the prosecutor the viral post is talking about (more on that later).","The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that the vice president learned about his son's role on the board through media reports and never discussed anything related to this company with his son.","In a White House press briefing onMay 13, 2014, spokesman Jay Carney was asked about it, and whether it presented the appearance of a conflict of interest.","Carney said, \"I would refer you to the Vice President\u2019s office. I saw those reports. Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the Vice President or President. But I would refer you to the Vice President\u2019s office.\"","A year and a half later, theNew York Timespublished an article that suggested that \"the credibility of the vice president\u2019s anti-corruption message may have been undermined\" by Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings with the company.","In that 2015 article, Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for the vice president, played down any impact on the elder Biden\u2019s policies.","\"Hunter Biden is a private citizen and a lawyer,\" she said. \"The vice president does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company. The vice president has pushed aggressively for years, both publicly with groups like the U.S.-Ukraine Business Forum and privately in meetings with Ukrainian leaders, for Ukraine to make every effort to investigate and prosecute corruption in accordance with the rule of law. It will once again be a key focus during his trip this week.\"","Hunter Bidentold the New York Timesthis month in a statement that \"at no time have I discussed with my father the company\u2019s business, or my board service, including my initial decision to join the board.\"","The post said Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion unless the prosecutor -- Shokin -- was fired. Biden didn\u2019t just make a threat to withhold aid unless Shokin was sacked -- it succeeded.","Biden proudly recounted the moment during an event sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations onJan. 23, 2018. Here\u2019s the relevant portion of Biden\u2019s remarks, which at points were accompanied by laughter from the audience:","\"I remember going over (to Ukraine), convincing our team ... that we should be providing for loan guarantees. ... And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from (then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) and from (then-Prime Minister Arseniy) Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor (Shokin). And they didn\u2019t. ...","\"They were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, ... we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, \u2018You have no authority. You\u2019re not the president.\u2019 ... I said, call him. I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. ... I looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\"","Shokin\u2019s ouster came inMarch 2016, when he was stripped of his position by awide marginin the legislature.","There\u2019s a strong case that Hunter Biden\u2019s position with the company had nothing to do with Biden\u2019s position on Shokin\u2019s ouster. That\u2019s because Western leaders and institutions were largely united in seeking Shokin\u2019s removal, arguing that he was not pursuing corruption cases aggressively.","For instance, in early 2016, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagardesaidthat \"it\u2019s hard to see how the I.M.F.-supported program can continue\" unless corruption prosecutions accelerate.","Steven Pifer is a career foreign service officer who was ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton and deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs under President George W. Bush. Pifer told PolitiFact that \"virtually everyone\" he knew in the U.S. government and virtually all non-governmental experts on Ukraine \"felt that Shokin was not doing his job and should be fired. As far as I can recall, they all concurred with the vice president telling Poroshenko that the U.S. government would not extend the $1 billion loan guarantee to Ukraine until Shokin was removed from office.\"","Anders \u00c5slund, a resident senior fellow at Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington, agreed that criticism of Shokin was widespread","Shokin \"failed to prosecute anybody of significance, protecting both the Yanukovych circle and the Poroshenko group,\" \u00c5slund said.","Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a leading anti-corruption voice in Ukraine,tweetedearlier this month that Shokin\u2019s firing was not about protecting the company Hunter Biden was working for. The firing \"was obviously not because the prosecutor wanted to investigate Burisma & Zlochevsky,\" she wrote.","Meanwhile, accounts differ on whether Shokin was poised to prosecute Burisma at the time he was removed.","In aninterviewwith the Ukrainian website Strana.ua this month, Shokin said the cases were indeed active.","However, Vitaliy Kasko, who had been Shokin\u2019s deputy overseeing international cooperation before resigning in February 2016 citing corruption in the office, produced documents toBloombergthat under Shokin, the investigation into Burisma had been dormant.","\"There was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close cases against Zlochevsky,\" Kasko told Bloomberg. \"It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\"","We found wide agreement among Ukraine policy experts that Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to become a director for Burisma presented a serious conflict of interest.","\"It\u2019s not a crime, but it is a lapse. It\u2019s troubling,\" said Lincoln A. Mitchell, an adjunct research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies who has written about governance in the former Soviet Union.","Pifer, who expressed reservations about the arrangement to theNew York Timesin 2015, said subsequent developments have only confirmed those concerns.","\"It was a mistake for Hunter Biden to join the Burisma board, particularly given that the vice president was the senior U.S. official engaging Ukraine,\" Pifer said. \"Hunter Biden should have been more mindful of his father's position.\"","And Yoshiko Herrera, a University of Wisconsin professor who previously headed the university\u2019s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia, said Hunter Biden\u2019s hiring echoes the strategy common within Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union, in which powerful interests try to secure influence on foreign policy by leveraging family members and associates of key leaders.","\"Calling Hunter Biden a private citizen ignores the obvious links to the vice president,\" Herrera said. \"Conflict-of-interest rules should have applied. If Biden is working for the Obama administration on Ukraine, his son should not have been on the board of a company there that could be affected by U.S. policy spearheaded by his father.\""]}

Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they\u2019ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California).\"","With claims about border crossings boomeranging from Sacramento to Washington D.C., we decided to scrutinize the governor\u2019s statement in a fact check.","In this Sept. 15, 2015, file photo, a farmer passes along a borer fence that divides his property, Tuesday, in Mission, Texas. (AP Photo\/Eric Gay)","Our research","To support it, the governor\u2019s spokesman citedU.S. Border Patrol figuresfor apprehensions across California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The data is from 1960 through 2017.","For 2017, they show 303,916 arrests across the entire Southern border. The previous low was 263,991 in 1971, 46 years ago.","So, Brown\u2019s claim that apprehensions in 2017 were \"as low as they\u2019ve been in nearly 50 years\" is on the mark.","He\u2019s also right that 85 percent of these took place \"outside California.\" About 68 percent of the arrests took place in Texas and New Mexico, while Arizona accounted for 17 percent and California about 15 percent, according to a review of the border patrol figures.","\"He is absolutely correct,\" saidEv Meade, director of the Trans Border Institute at the University of San Diego. \"Even as we\u2019re at an historic low borderwide, it\u2019s particularly low in California. We\u2019re not receiving large numbers of migrants. Those migrants who are coming are largely crossing the Rio Grande and are apprehended at border patrol stations in Texas.\"","Meade said the overall trend on the Southern border shows a dramatic decrease in apprehensions.","\"In the year 2000, the border patrol apprehended 1.6 million people (borderwide). For 2017, it was down to 300,000. It\u2019s a tiny fraction,\" he said.","Just along California\u2019s border, nearly 390,000 people were arrested in 2000. By 2017, that number had dropped to less than 45,000, border patrol figures show.","SOURCE: Trans Border Institute, University of San Diego","Wave of migrants?","While the governor\u2019s numbers are right, do they prove the first part of his claim: \"There is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California?\"","Given the context of the letter, Brown is clearly referring to migrants crossing into the state across the border with Mexico.","But what about the other ways people enter the state?","Joseph Hayes, a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California, pointed out that border arrests aren\u2019t necessarily the best metric to evaluate migration to California.","Much of the nation\u2019s and state\u2019s undocumented population results from individuals overstaying visas. In a 2017report, the Center For Migration Studies found that two-thirds of those who arrived in the United States in 2014 and later would be counted as undocumented were admitted on temporary visas \"and then overstayed their period of admission or otherwise violated the terms of their visas.\"","Still, Hayes said, the overall number of people living illegally in California has declined since before the Great Recession. The state was home to approximately 3 million undocumented residents in 2007, a figure that\u2019s dropped to as low as 2.35 million, according toestimatesreviewed by PPIC.","The decline in the state\u2019s undocumented population reinforces Brown\u2019s contention there\u2019s \"no massive wave of migrants pouring into California.\"","Historically, Meade added, thousands of seasonal migrant farmworkers have come to California through the border with Mexico. He said that seasonal migration has largely \"dried up\" in recent years and many undocumented farmworkers now stay in the state year-round, rather than crossing back into Mexico.","\"International migration has become more difficult,\" he said, citing greater border enforcement.","2018 spike in crossings","Brown cited figures from 2017. But what about the200 percent spikein apprehensions borderwide in March 2018 compared with the same month a year ago, as cited this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen?","Meade, of the Trans Border Institute, said the 2018 increase should be considered in context. It follows the historically low number of 2017 arrests, which has been attributed, in part, to fewer people trying to illegally cross the border due to Trump\u2019s election and hard-line immigration stance.","Immigration experts have also cited the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive deportation efforts and greater economic opportunities in Mexico for recent declines in border crossings.","Meade also noted the 2018 increase took place during spring, the high-point of migration season.","He said it doesn\u2019t represent a long-term trend. Nor does it show California is experiencing a disproportionate share of the 2018 increase, he said.","\"Unless this were to continue for months and months and months and break the seasonal pattern, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real way to claim (the early part of 2018) is a crisis.\"","Our ruling"]}

Nevertheless, Hamer said, false positives with PCR tests, even those with relatively high cycle thresholds, remain rare.","\"PCR tests are considered the gold standard of diagnostic tests,\" said Maureen Ferran, an associate professor of biology at the Rochester Institute of Technology.","Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, cautioned against viewing a low cycle threshold value as a strict indicator of high infectivity,  because some samples are less representative of the patient\u2019s overall viral load than others.","\"It depends on how good the sample is,\" he said. The cycle threshold value \"will measure the viral load for a particular sample, but not necessarily a patient.\"","In addition, the amount of cycles required to determine whether a patient is positive varies among different types of PCR tests.","\"There are different tests that have different thresholds,\" said Ben Neuman, a Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist. \"Each lab knows where the thresholds are, and it\u2019s their job to give you the results of your test based on their setup.\"","That\u2019s why the WHO notice urges lab technicians to view weak positive test results (ones with high cycle thresholds) with caution and to consult the instructions on their PCR machinery before issuing positive or negative test results.","Gateway Pundit did not respond to our request for comment."]}

But for some in Wisconsin, that\u2019s not possible. They\u2019re forced to watch Viking games.\"","Not possible to watch Packers games?","\"Ron Johnson believes all Wisconsinites deserve to enjoy Packer games, and their local news,\" the narrator continues. \"That\u2019s why, when he went to Washington, he got a law passed to fix it. And he did it in his first term. One broadcast station already plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties. And other broadcasters across northern Wisconsin will have the opportunity to offer coverage.\"","Rescuing thousands of Wisconsinites fans from having to watch Vikings games sounds like the politician\u2019s equivalent of returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.","So, why haven\u2019t we heard the crowds cheering?","The problem isn\u2019t as pervasive as the ad states.","And, so far, the law only offers the possibility of fixing the problem.","\u2018Not possible\u2019 in \u2018orphan counties\u2019","There is a phenomenon in broadcasting called \"orphan counties.\" It occurs when a county in one state is assigned to a local television market in a neighboring state. In 13 northern Wisconsin counties, including Ashland and Iron, according to abroadcast industry blog, the local channels, including the local news, are from stations in either the Minneapolis-St. Paul or Duluth TV markets.","That means that if the Packers and Vikings play at the same time on the same network, but not against each other, viewers in the orphan counties are shown the Vikings game, not the Packers game.","That occurred six times in the 2015 season and is expected to occur twice in the 2016 season (NFL game times are subject to change),according tothe Ashland Daily Press.","On those days, viewers in orphan counties can see the Packers games only if they subscribe to a satellite service and pay an additional fee for NFL package.","So, Johnson overstates the problem when he says it\u2019s not possible for some Wisconsin residents to watch Packers games. That happens, at most, several times per season. But it\u2019s true that on those days, Wisconsinites in \"orphan counties\" are shown Vikings games rather than Packers games.","Now to the fix Johnson talks about.","The law to \u2018fix it\u2019","In 2014, when Congress reauthorized a satellite television law, a provision was included to address the orphan counties problem. But it requires apetition to be filedand the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.","So, when Johnson says he \"got a law passed,\" it\u2019s not as though the law itself fixes the problem.","Johnson takes credit for the petition provision. And while it\u2019s clear he supports the provision, doing so in a December 2015letterto the FCC, his campaign could not cite evidence that he was responsible for the provision.","So, that part of the claim is unclear. But to be fair to Johnson, there isn\u2019t necessarily a formal record on how provisions get inserted into a law.","Johnsondoes supportthe first petition filed under the new provision -- one filed in September 2016 by WSAW-TV in Wausau (part 1andpart 2).","But when the ad says one station \"plans to use this law to provide Packer games to Iron and Ashland counties,\" that\u2019s misleading in that WSAW\u2019s petition must get FCC approval.","The petition seeks to have satellite providers --there are twoin the United States -- DirecTV and DISH Network -- carry its signal to some orphan county viewers, those in Ashland and Iron counties. That would allow satellite TV subscribers in those areas to see Packers games that aren\u2019t shown there now, without any additional fees.","\"In a state where the Packers are publicly owned and religiously followed, orphan county viewers feel an affront akin to forcing Washington (Redskins) football fans to watch nothing but Dallas Cowboys,\" WSAW wrote to the FCC, which is based in Washington, D.C.","But the petition applies to only two of the orphan counties. Moreover, DirecTVtold Johnsonin October 2016 it was technically possible to carry WSAW\u2019s signal to only to four of 11 ZIP codes in Iron County.","In short, there are many unknowns.","The FCC told us it has until Feb. 6, 2017 to decide on WSAW\u2019s petition. WDIO-TV in Duluthis objectingto it. The FCCmust determinewhether granting the petition is in a county\u2019s interest and whether it would be economically and technically feasible for satellite providers to carry the WSAW signal. And if it approves the petition, the FCC might order only order one satellite carry to pick up WSAW\u2019s signal, not necessarily both.","Indeed, one of Johnson\u2019s Senate staff members has essentially said that no fix has been achieved yet.","\"Everything in government is slow, but we do think we are very close to a real solution that will give Wisconsinites real change,\" aide Brooke Ericson told theAshland newspaperin commenting about the WSAW petition. \"Just this petition going to the FCC, I think, is a further step in the right direction.

Polling shows that key elements of Sanders\u2019 economic platform are strongly popular among Democrats. And several of them score majority support among all voters.","However, support among all voters for some of Sanders\u2019 proposals declines when poll respondents are told about the costs. And in some cases, less-aggressive policy options \u2014 some of them backed by Sanders\u2019 competitors \u2014 receive wider support from voters than his proposals do.","We looked at several elements of Sanders\u2019 platform that could potentially have an impact on the economy. They include instituting single-payer health care; the Green New Deal to combat climate change; tuition-free college; student debt forgiveness; a $15 minimum wage; breaking up big banks, and paid family leave.","We found broad acceptance among economists that at least some of these policies would qualify as \"reordering\" the economy.","By shifting payments from private insurers to the federal government, single-payer health care would dramatically change the health care sector, which accounts for17.7% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.","This policy, and breaking up big banks, \"would change things in a major way,\" said Stanford University economist Roger Noll. \"These are huge sectors.\"","The Green New Deal would affect a smaller,but still substantial, share of the economy that relates to energy, by setting aggressive targets for phasing out fossil fuels. The proposal also includes a federal job guarantee.","Economists\u2019 views vary on the scale of the other proposals, but some said that changes to the higher-education sector \u2014 making college tuition free and forgiving student loan debt \u2014 could have a significant impact on the economy. And while the impact of other aspects of Sanders\u2019 plan, such as a $15 minimum wage or paid family leave, might be less dramatic, they could have significant effects on certain regions and employment sectors.","\"It's quite fair to say he is reordering the economy, given the massive transfer of money from the private sector to the government,\" said Daniel Mitchell,a pro-free market economist.","We collected recent poll results on most of these proposals and put them into the chart below. The questions in these polls did not identify the ideas as being backed by Sanders, and they offered basic descriptions of the plans, without mentioning complications, such as the cost involved.","The data shows that \u2014 contrary to what Buttigieg said \u2014 a large share of Democrats support Sanders\u2019 economic proposals, according to polls. Among Democrats, single-payer health care receives upwards of 58% support, the Green New Deal gets 86%, a $15 minimum wage gets 84%, tuition-free college gets 76%, student-loan forgiveness gets 79%, breaking up big banks gets 60%, and paid family leave gets 94%.","Among all Americans, only one of these policies \u2014 single-payer health care \u2014 gets less than 50% support. Paid family leave got 84% support, while the other policies had support levels in the 53% to 63% range among all voters.","That said, other poll results give Buttigieg\u2019s remark some support.","First, when we inquired about his comment, the Buttigieg camp pointed to health insurance.","As it turns out, Buttigieg\u2019s own policy preference \u2014 a public option to buy into Medicare for those who want it \u2014 wins majority support from all Americans, a level of support significantly stronger than the 30% to 40% national approval rates for a Sanders-style single-payer system.","In February 2020, theKaiser Family Foundation tracking pollfound that 44% of voters preferred a public option, compared to 26% of voters who preferred single-payer and 23% who opposed both. Democrats alone also expressed a preference for the public option, with 51% favoring the public option compared to 39% for single-payer.","Second, providing poll respondents with more complete descriptions of a policy option \u2014 often including the cost required \u2014 usually reduced the levels of support. Here are some examples:","\u2022$15 minimum wage. A SurveyMonkeypoll conducted for Business Insiderasked two questions about the $15 minimum wage. The first was, \"Do you support or oppose increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour?\" This question elicited 63% support among all respondents.","The second question added that the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 the non-partisan number-crunching arm of Congress \u2014 found that a $15 minimum wage would increase wages for 27 million workers and lift 1.3 million households out of poverty, but could also eliminate 1.3 million jobs. Adding this caveat dropped support levels to just 37%.","\u2022Student loan forgiveness. AQuinnipiac University poll in April 2019asked two questions about a plan for student loan forgiveness.","First, the pollsters asked, \"Do you support or oppose the federal government forgiving up to $50,000 in student loans for individuals who live in households that make less than $250,000 a year?\" This won support from 57% of all Americans, and 79% of Democrats.","Then they asked, \"Would you support or oppose this plan to forgive student loans if it was paid for by a new tax on wealthy individuals?\" On this question, Democratic support remained strong \u2014 72% \u2014 but reaction among respondents overall turned negative, with 44% support and 52% opposition.","\u2022Paid family leave. A survey sponsored by the libertarianCato Instituteshowed strong initial support \u2014 74% among all respondents \u2014 for a paid family leave program granting 12 weeks for birth, adoption, or medical need. But support dropped significantly when possible impacts were mentioned. The poll found that only 48% would still support the policy if it cost another $450 a year in taxes.","\u2022Green New Deal. AWashington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation pollin July and August 2019 found broad support for individual elements of the Green New Deal, which Sanders backs. These include a jobs guarantee (78%), energy efficiency improvements for existing buildings (70%), a goal of 100 percent of U.S. power coming from emissions-free sources within 10 years (69%), increased federal spending on disaster-prevention infrastructure (67%), new regulations on businesses (61%), and reductions in coal mining jobs (55%).","The one unpopular aspect of the plan? Increasing spending by trillions of dollars, which was backed by just 30% of respondents."]}

Drug treatment is typically initiated at hubs, where people suffering from opioid abuse disorder can get daily doses of their medication, along with counseling and referrals to social services. Less intensive services are provided at so-called \"spokes,\" a collection of about 90 providers made up of doctor\u2019s offices and community clinics, where patients can get follow-up care.","The numbers tracked by the state do show a precipitous decline in waitlists at hubs since 2017.

The state doesn\u2019t formally track how many people might be waiting for treatment from providers.","Beth Tanzman, the executive director of the Blueprint for Health, which oversees the spokes, says the state has \"a pretty good sense of what access looks like\" through regular check-ins.","\"Our understanding right now is that we are able to get everyone into care easily within 72 hours,\" she said.","In Chittenden County, people are typically able to access same-day treatment, Tanzman said.

Residents are left to fend for themselves.\"","The tweet cited a KVUE article that highlighted an advisory from the Austin Police Department warning residents to secure their homes before going on a trip. The article noted 2,983 burglaries had occurred through the first eight months of this year \u2014 an 11% increase over the first eight months of last year, according to the Austin Police Department\u2019s August crime report.","But burglary is not the only form of property crime, and Abbott\u2019s assertion that property crime is rising in Austin fails to take that into account.","Property crime generally has been falling in Austin, with the notable recent exceptions of 2018 and 2019. So far this year, property crime has dropped slightly. And Abbott\u2019s attempt to link crime to the City Council\u2019s budget decision misses the mark.","It\u2019s not the first time Abbott has sounded off on Austin crime.","In August, Abbott claimed that crime is on the rise in Austin, citing data that showed a jump in homicides over the first six months of the year. We rated that claimHalf True.","Austin\u2019s property crime","Each month, the Austin Police Department posts to its website the Chief\u2019s Monthly Report, which tallies the number and category of crimes officers respond to each month. The 2,983 burglaries cited in the KVUE article comprise 9% of all property crimes recorded through August. Other crimes that fall into this category include shoplifting, credit card fraud, embezzlement and vandalism.","Austin police responded to nearly 34,000 total property crimes through August, which is a 2% drop compared with 2019. According to FBI data, property crime in Austin increased in 2018 by 8.5% and in 2019 by 8.7%.","But taking a longer view, the property crime rate has generally been falling over the last decade. In addition to 2018 and 2019, the only other year since 2010 when the rate did not drop compared to the previous year was in 2012.","In 2010 Austin police responded to nearly 46,000 reports of property crime, or about 5.8 incidents per 100 residents, according to federal data. In 2019, officers responded to 36,588 reports, or about 3.7 incidents per 100 residents. Burglaries specifically also have been dropping, from about 1.1 incidents per 100 residents in 2010 to about 0.4 in 2019.","Abbott is not the only Texas elected official who\u2019s rebuked Austin leaders for cutting the Austin police budget. Several other Republicans have seized on Austin\u2019s police spending as an issue in their reelection campaigns.","The perception of high crime in Austin reflects a popular misconception that crime is always on the rise despite a general downward trend, said Texas State University criminologist Sean Roche. On average, crime in the U.S. has declined since the mid-1990s to historically low and stable levels.","That\u2019s generally true for Austin\u2019s property crime rates as well. Federal data going back to 1985 show a peak of property crime incidents in 1990 followed by a decade of low property crime until a smaller peak in 2009.","\"Even though crime went up in the 60s, 70s and 80s and then started declining in the 90s, most of the public did not ever catch wise of this,\" Roche said. \"There\u2019s a significant chunk of people in the U.S. that always think crime is getting worse.\"","Some researchers have suggested that a false perception of high crime may be attributable to a person\u2019s level of media exposure, especially local TV news. A study published in 2018 by Roche and colleagues note that this misperception may have significant implications for criminal justice policies, which are \"particularly sensitive to public opinion\" compared to other policy domains.","\"Over-concern about crime is likely to mobilize the public to be more punitive, thereby fueling support for increased law enforcement spending and harsh sentencing policies,\" Roche and his coauthors wrote. \"Public punitiveness is one of the strongest predictors of both federal and state incarceration rates.\"","Crime and police budgets","After asserting that the property crime rate in Austin is rising, Abbott\u2019s tweet goes on to claim that rising crime is \"the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police.\"","It\u2019s unclear what the governor means when he says \"deemphasize police\" \u2014 his office did not respond to multiple requests for comment \u2014 but we can be sure what city he\u2019s referring to when talking about defunding. The Austin City Council recently decided to cut $21.5 million from the police budget and shifted another $128 million from the Police Department to other city departments to continue civilian-run functions, such as the 911 call center and forensics.","The cuts came after protests against police brutality in Austin and across the nation demanded police reforms in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis police custody in May.","But how the council\u2019s budgetary decisions will affect the department\u2019s daily operations, especially in regard to property crime, is not yet known.","\"In terms of staffing changes, that\u2019s something we\u2019re still working on,\" said Austin police spokeswoman Tara Long. \"We\u2019re still working on those specifics.\"","Austin Police Chief Brian Manley indicated in August that the department may reduce or eliminate about a dozen police units while reassigning those officers to patrol duties. The cuts also will cancel three upcoming cadet classes and reduce overtime spending.","But does a smaller police force automatically heighten crime? Research would suggest that there is a weak or nonexistent connection between the two. One systematic review by criminologists at the University of Cincinnati concludes that the overall effect of police force size on crime is \"statistically not significant,\" although it is possible that force size might influence some crimes more than others.","\"Policy makers who want police to have an impact on crime would be better suited investing resources in new evidence-based strategies than funding surges in police hiring,\" the 2016 review says.","Rather, crime trends are more influenced by macro-level drivers, like the prevalence of firearms in a community, alcohol consumption, drug use, unemployment and a population\u2019s age structure, Roche said.","\"Austin, on average, has historically been a very safe city,\" he said. \"It\u2019s premature to say definitively that a budget decision that was made a couple months ago has already had these very dramatic impacts on crime rates.

Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996.","\"I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.\"","But that's not what happened, as demonstrated byCBS News videothat shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. TheWashington PostFact Checker also turned a skeptical eye on Clinton's comments, reporting that a review of more than 100 news stories from the time documented no security threats to the First Lady.","CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, who covered Clinton on the Bosnia visit,wrote of her memories of the trip: \"To be sure, it was not the 'safest' trip for a first lady to take: there were serious risks in traveling to Bosnia, even for the president's wife under the vigilant protection of the U.S. military. It took some guts for her to go. But I don't recall, and did not note, any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers. \"","Immediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. \"There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened,\" she said.","But she retracted the remarks a week later, telling the PhiladelphiaDaily Newseditorial board on March 24, 2008, that she \"misspoke,\" correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, \"So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation.\"","On the campaign trail, Clinton has discussed the danger of the trip before and how it gave her important foreign policy experience. TheDes Moines Registerreported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, \"We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there.\"","Interestingly, Clinton's memoirLiving Historydepicts an arrival that, though dangerous, included neither actual sniper fire nor running. It matches the CBS footage and appears to contradict Clinton's later retelling:","\"Security conditions were constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and they had recently deteriorated again. Due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip, we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children, though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find. One eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled 'Peace.' \"","There's no doubt flying into Bosnia was dangerous back in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down. And there was a welcoming ceremony where a young girl gave her a poem.","Our ruling"]}

The Senate failed to pass its own measure.","Before Obamacare, as the Republicans called it, older adults paid about four or five times more for premiums than what younger adults paid, according to a Kaiser Family Foundationanalysis.","Obamacare changed the rules so that insurance companies could still charge older adults more than younger adults, but only by up to three times.","Here\u2019s a sample of the 2018age rating curve:","\u2022 A 50-year-old pays 1.786 times the amount that a younger person pays;","\u2022 A 55-year-old pays 2.230 times the amount that a younger person pays; and","\u2022 Someone 64 and older pays 3 times the amount that a younger person pays.","The 2017 House bill that Sinema voted against sought to increase the ratio to 5-to-1 for certain adults over 50. It allowed states to set a different ratio. However, the proposal didn\u2019t apply to seniors on Medicare, or people older than 50 who had coverage through large employers.","Katie Keith, a researcher for the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, said the policy change would have made overall premiums \"significantly more unaffordable.\"","The Trump administration would have to figure out how to set an age rating curve, Keith said, \"but all of these numbers would shift up significantly, even if not five times as much, at all ages over 50.\"","The age rating works on a curve that increases with each year of age (for adults), so \"it's probably most accurate to say that seniors 50 and over could be charged up to 5 times more,\" Keith said.","It's an open question as to whether Arizona would have set a different ratio under the Republican repeal, Keith said. Under current law, states canrequest ratios less thanthe federal standard, but Arizona \u2014 like most states \u2014 hasn\u2019t done that, Keith said.","The 2017 health care bill also could have increased health care costs for older adults, because the legislation would have replaced income-based tax credits with acredit based on age.","Under the proposal, adults under 30 would get a $2,000 credit; adults over 60, a $4,000 credit; and individuals who made more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who filed jointly earning $150,000) would have tax credits phased out.","According to AARP calculations, under AHCA, 50- to 64-year-olds making $25,000 annually would be eligible for tax credits that are on average 50 to 80 percent less than what they would receive under current law.","\"Generally, people who are older, lower-income, or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA,\" said a Kaiser Family Foundationanalysis. \"Additionally, older people would have higher starting premiums under the AHCA and would therefore pay higher premiums.\""]}

Depending on the circumstances, it can belegal or illegal.","In April 2012, the STOCK Act \u2013 which stands for Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge \u2013 specifically said lawmakers could not use their insider knowledge to trade stocks. It also created several new or stronger ethics and transparency provisions for members of Congress and their staffs.","President Obama asked Congress to pass the bill in his 2012 State of the Union address. A few months later, he got his wish and signed it into law with much fanfare. It was a rare moment of bipartisan celebration, although Ross is right that Burr was one of three holdouts.","Burr said insider trading was already illegal, so there was no need to pass another law singling out members of Congress.","\"It is illegal, in law, even for Congress, to trade on insider trading,\" Burr said in response to Ross\u2019 barb at their debate. \"That\u2019s the reason I opposed the STOCK Act. North Carolinians did not send me to Washington to duplicate existing law, and that\u2019s in fact what the STOCK Act did.\"","Burr, however, is wrong to speak so definitively about that claim.","Legal confusion","There is no statutory definition of when exactly insider trading becomes illegal, so it\u2019s often up to individual judges or investigators to decide.","While Congress was never specifically exempted from insider trading rules, there was widespread disagreement in the legal and financial communities over what officials could or couldn\u2019t do.","If you\u2019re in the mood for a 59-page legal analysis of the differing opinions,read this 2011 paper. Or, here\u2019s a brief synopsis: Some people said the law applied to everyone in Congress. Some said elected officials had to abide by insider trading laws, but their staffers did not. Some said both elected officials and their staffs were exempt.","Since the Securities and Exchange Commission is in charge of policing insider trading, we decided to see what its officials thought at the time. Unfortunately, two high-level officials gave opposite interpretations of the law.","Former SEC CEO Arthur Levitt said in 2010 that elected officials and their staffers \"benefit from an exemption that the average investor doesn\u2019t benefit from. They\u2019re immune from insider trading laws.\" However, former SEC director of enforcement Robert Khuzamisaidin 2011 that neither elected officials nor their staffers were \"exempt from the federal securities laws, including the insider trading prohibitions.\"","So the STOCK Act at least cleared up confusion from 2012 onward. And at best, it made real changes.","Congressional suspicions","Regardless of the lack of clarity in the law, we do know that members of Congress and their staffers routinely made timely trades centered around upcoming policy decisions.","One 2004 paper found that senators who made stock trades outperformed the market by an impressive 12 percent, on average.","\"Since even the best hedge-fund managers find it hard to achieve comparable results, we must conclude that these senators either are better than hedge-fund managers, or that they benefit from privileged information,\" Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, wrote in 2011.","Zingales said it was his opinion that members of Congress did participate in insider trading, \"despite the potential cost to their reputations.\"","In 2010 the Wall Street Journal investigatedallegations of insider tradingby congressional staffers. It found dozens of aides on both sides of the aisle had invested tens of thousands of dollars in stocks that soon benefitted from their bosses\u2019 policy decisions.","One aide nearly doubled his investment in a renewable energy company just before his boss pushed for a new law that benefitted companies like it.

Tony Evers issued a statewide face mask mandate, despite opposition from Republicans who contend the move amounts to government overreach.","In the days before that, though, the state Senate\u2019s Democratic Committee turned its frustration toward Republican lawmakers.","\"While neighboring states like Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan have already implemented safety precautions like requiring individuals to wear masks, similar pleas in Wisconsin have fallen on deaf ears of Republican legislators,\" stated aJuly 24 news release.","Lawmakers in those states have passed more COVID-19-related bills than Wisconsin\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature since the pandemic began. But some precautions, like a mask mandate, came from executive orders and not legislation.","How does the committee\u2019s claim stack up?","Eric LaGesse, executive director of the Senate\u2019s Democratic committee, did not respond to PolitiFact Wisconsin\u2019s request for evidence to back up their claim. But the claim is pretty straightforward, and there has been a lot of news coverage of the state\u2019s response to the pandemic. Here\u2019s a recap:","In March, Evers and Health Services Secretary Andrea Palmissued a series of ordersto curb large gatherings as COVID-19 began to emerge in Wisconsin. Those actions culminated in a stay-at-home order on March 24, 2020, which shut down the state to help contain the virus\u2019 spread.","In April, lawmakers passed acoronavirus relief packagethat allowed the state to tap into extra federal Medicaid dollars and suspended a one-week waiting period for collecting unemployment benefits, among other provisions. However, the state lost$25 million in federal funding for unemploymentbecause Republican leaders waited too long to schedule a floor session on the relief package.","Evers\u2019 administration extended the stay-at-home order on April 16 and four days later unveiled the Badger Bounce Back plan, which provided a phased approach for reopening based on testing and other public health criteria. In May, acting on a lawsuit from state GOP leaders, the state Supreme Courtstruck down much of the orderand allowed the state to reopen without any protocols in place.","After that, not much happened at the state level until the mask mandate despite a recent surge in infections and multiple daily increases of over 1,000 cases.","Lawmakers have introduced 10 bills related to the pandemic in recent months,the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The relief package we mentioned earlier is the only one that\u2019s passed.","The Democratic committee argued neighboring states -- specifically Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan -- have implemented more safety precautions for their residents.","According to a database maintained by theNational Conference of State Legislatures, Minnesota enacted 25 pieces of legislation related to COVID-19 through July 23 after lawmakers introduced over 200 measures. Illinois has passed 18, and Michigan approved 19. The bills touch on a wide range of issues, from COVID-19 testing to election procedures.","The differences between Wisconsin and its neighbors can\u2019t be blamed on partisan gridlock, either. While Democrats control Illinois\u2019 state government, Minnesota\u2019s legislature is split between both parties with a Democrat in the governor\u2019s office. Michigan, like Wisconsin, has a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature.","It\u2019s worth noting, though, that some of the precautions in other states came about through executive orders by their governors, not action by the legislature. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzer, for example,issued an order on June 26requiring residents to wear face coverings -- over a month before Evers enacted a mask mandate in Wisconsin.","Governors in other states also enacted stay-at-home orders similar to what Evers implemented."]}

During a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Obama said that \"you don\u2019t see murder on this kind of scale, this kind of frequency in any other advanced nation on Earth.\"","Still, Obama\u2019s words were not without criticism. We flagged one claim from John R. Lott, Jr., founder of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a pro-gun research group.","\"The thing that most disappoints me with regard to the president is he just keeps on putting out information that is clearly false,\" Lott said on Fox News June 24, 2015. \"I mean, in the clip that you had, the United States doesn\u2019t have the highest murder rate among developed countries.","\"You look at Russia, you look at Brazil, those are countries that have 3 to 5 times higher murder rates than what we have here in the United States. There are other countries which are similar to us.\"","PunditFact decided to take a closer look at his claim. We found Lott referenced the same information in anarticlepublished in theNew York Daily Newsthat same day.","\"Among developed countries ... the U.S. isn\u2019t anywhere close to having the highest homicide rate. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the arbiter of which countries are considered industrialized, ranks Russia and Brazil far ahead of the U.S., with homicide rates that are respectively 2 1\/2 to five times higher than ours. Our rate was tied with Chile\u2019s, and just slightly above the average for developed countries.\"","Lott\u2019s claim has a couple areas worthy of fact checking. First of all, do Russia\u2019s and Brazil\u2019s crime rates match what Lott said? And second, are Russia and Brazil even considered to be developed countries as Lott seems to indicate?","Just the numbers","PunditFact reached out to Lott for more information about his claim. Lott citeddatagathered by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).","According to the report (which includes statistics for 2011, the latest available year), the United States has a homicide rate of 5.2 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Comparatively, Russia has a homicide rate of 12.8 murders, and Brazil has a rate of 25.5 murders.","With these numbers, Russia\u2019s rate comes out to be 2.46 times greater than that of the United States, and Brazil\u2019s murder rate comes out to be 4.90 times larger than that of the United States.","Lott mentioned Chile in his op-ed in theDaily News. That country\u2019s murder rate is 4.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, which is actually less than the rate of the United States.","Other sources largely support the OECD research, and Lott\u2019s use of the numbers. According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019sstudy, in 2011 the United States had a homicide rate of 4.7 murders per 100,000 people, Russia\u2019s murder rate was 9.6 per 100,000 people and Brazil\u2019s rate was 23.4.","According to this data, Russia\u2019s murder rate was 2.04 times higher than that of the United States, and Brazil\u2019s was 4.97 times greater. That\u2019s close to what Lott said.","Developed or Developing?","Now comes the trickier part of Lott\u2019s claim.","Lott was reacting to Obama\u2019s use of the word \"advanced\" to describe a group of countries, and saying Obama was providing false information. Lott described a group of counties with the word \"developed\" and included Brazil and Russia.","Those words are important, and whether you consider Brazil or Russia advanced and\/or developed makes all the difference.","The OECD iscurrently comprisedof 34 member countries andlistsBrazil and Russia as \"key partners.\"","But just because the OECD includes these 36 countries when compiling its Better Life Index does not mean that they are all automatically classified as developed nations.","The OECD\u2019s member countries \"include many of the world\u2019s most advanced countries but also emerging countries like Mexico, Chile and Turkey.\"","PunditFact reached out to OECD\u2019s Better Life Index to inquire what criteria was used to distinguish between \u2018developed\u2019 and \u2018developing\u2019 countries, but did not hear back.","However, other experts shed some light on the issue.","According to Massimo Morelli, Columbia University professor of political science and economics, Brazil and Russia are considered intermediate countries. They are not \"developing\" nations, but not quite considered \"advanced\/developed,\" either.","\"The so-called BRIC countries  (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are those who moved from developing to developed very fast due to fast growth rates, but they are definitely not advanced yet,\" Morelli said.","However, he did note that out of the four intermediate countries, both Russia and China may be considered advanced in some respects.","Leonid Peisakhin, assistant professor of politics at New York University in Abu Dhabi, agreed.","\"There is no hard definition for what an advanced country is. There are different markers having to do with human development levels, levels of industrialization, income per capita, size of the services sector, etc. Russia is a tricky case, as it is, in fact, highly industrialized; however, Russia does not have very high income or human development levels. Brazil is less ambiguously a developing economy,\" he said.","However, even some of these factors are not always clear cut.","\"If you define \u2018advanced\u2019 countries based on something simple such as per capita real GDP, I think that you are going to have a hard time including countries such as Chile, Poland, Greece, Portugal, and many others, but not include Russia,\" Lott said in a follow-up statement to PunditFact.","The World Bank uses GNI (Gross National Income), and not GDP, as its prime indicator. (The total national income is divided by the population of the country to determine the GNI per capita.)","In 2013, Brazil\u2019s GNI per capita was$11,690. Russia\u2019s was$13,850.","Using the World Bankdefinition, Brazil is classified as having an upper-middle-income economy, which places it under the category of a developing nation.","Russia is ranked as a high-income nation, and is not labeled as \"developing.\"","For comparison the U.S. GNI in 2013 was$53,470.","Meanwhile, the World Trade Organizationallowsmembers to decide for themselves how to classify themselves, although other member countries can dispute the decision.","\"Setting aside these ambiguities, there can be no doubt that the U.S. should be compared to other countries with similar levels of income and development and a similar historical trajectory: Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. These are all highly advanced and developed economies with similar historical trajectories and consequently functional rule of law systems,\" said Peisakhin.","One final note: Out of the nations observed, the United States\u2019 murder rate was only exceeded by three countries in the study: Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. (Mexico is considered emerging or developing by most organizations, including OECD.)","Our ruling"]}

The general point Gaetz was trying to make, his spokesman told us, was that he believes gun control failed in both Australia and Venezuela. He shared articles showing an Australianblack market for guns, for example, as well as other news stories about Venezuela\u2019s gun control laws leavingciviliansand evenpolice more vulnerable.","But there are several factual inaccuracies with his specific claim about Australia and the comparison to Venezuela.","\u2022 Australia didn\u2019t enact a total gun ban; it banned certain guns, including semi-automatics after a mass shooting in 1996.","\u2022 That\u2019s different from what Venezuela\u2019s government did in 2012 and 2013, when it took steps in an effort to stem the flow of guns.","\u2022 In both countries, millions of guns remain in civilian hands.Gun deathsare a major problem in Venezuela.","In 1996, ashootingin Tasmania left 35 dead. It was one of the most deadly civilian mass shootings in the world at the time. Theconservative-led national governmentmoved quickly toban and destroy certain guns.","Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms. After that, people possessing the weapons would be subject to strict penalties. The buyback program took in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons \u2014 roughlyone-fifthof the country\u2019s estimated guns.","Today, Australians still legally own a high per-capita ratio of single-shot long guns, along with plenty of handguns, said Philip Alpers, founding director ofGunpolicy.org, a global project of the Sydney School of Public Health. But thenumber of legal and illegal gunsdropped from about 3.2 million in 1996 to 2.5 million in 1997.","Since then, it has climbed back up to almost the same number as before the ban, though therate of gun ownershipis smaller today.","In the 1980s and early 1990s, Australia suffered 14 mass shootings, which claimed 117 lives, Alpers said. Following the gun law changes, there were no mass shootings for many years. In June 2019,four people were killed by a gunmanwho used abanned gun. In 2018,seven were killed in a mass family homicide-suicide.","What Venezuela did several years ago was not the same as Australia.","The gun situation was not the same, for starters. In Australia, the government responded to a mass shooting. Venezuela faced a widespread problem with rampant gun violence and homicides \u2014 and it still does.","In 2012,Venezuela imposed measuresto ban possession of a gun in public places and to halt private gun sales to citizens.","In 2013,President Nicolas Maduro signed a disarmament billthat was intended to stem the flow of guns.","The law created an automated system of registration for arms, parts, and ammunition under control of the armed forces. Individuals were allowed conditional possession, meaning that the state could take their gun.","Rebecca Hanson, an expert on crime in Venezuela and now a professor at the University of Florida, said she wouldn\u2019t call the 2013 law a \"gun ban,\" because civilians could still own guns as long as they registered them. Also, guns remained widely available on the black market and enforcement was lax.","\"The law, in reality, did not affect people's ability to access guns in any effective or long-term way,\" she said.","Since the majority of guns are purchased on the black market, regulating the legal market does little to reduce gun sales in Venezuela, she said. Many of these guns end up flowing from state security forces and the military into the black market.","\"All of this is to say that even with the 2013 law, access to guns has increased,\" she said.","Alejandro Velasco, New York University history professor of modern Latin America, told us that \"the gun ban had almost no practical impact on people\u2019s ability to buy and keep (or use) weapons.\"","There are no solid numbers to pinpoint the number of guns in civilian ownership in Venezuela.Gunpolicy.orgestimates that there were about5.9 million privately owned guns in civilian hands in Venezuelaas of 2017, though the consultant that came up with it said it could be a wide range.","The opposition movement has billed itself as nonviolent for the most part, Velasco said. Several experts told us it\u2019s not surprising that civilians don\u2019t bring guns to protests where they face the armed government.","\"Even if the disarmament law had dramatically reduced gun ownership, which is not at all clear, armed anti-government civilians would stand no chance against the tanks and fighter jets of the army,\" said Dorothy Kronick, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist.","Experts were critical of Gaetz using the problems in Venezuela to make any commentary on gun laws in the United States.","\"Linking the issue of arms control with the struggle for democracy in the Venezuelan context only contributes to distort a situation that is already very distorted,\" Keymer Avila, a professor of criminology at the Central University of Venezuela said, \"increasing violence in an environment that is already very violent, and undermines an institution that is already very precarious.\""]}

Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013,\" Willett continues.","Did Texas high school graduates get so much more college-primed that fast?","Best we could tell, the cited figures track with state test results tracked by the Texas Education Agency. Then again, as few as 26 percent of Texas high-school graduates lately show a readiness for college according to a couple of other respected metrics.","Texas Success Initiative","With help from Texas Education Agency officials, we found figures very close to what Willett presents in the 2016 majority opinion. According to the agency, in 2004, 29 percent of students fulfilled college readiness standards for English language arts and 43 percent did so for math while in 2013, 65 percent of students met readiness standards for English, 66 percent for math. With rare exception, according to the agency, the percentage of students fulfilling each readiness standard escalated steadily through the intervening years. And most recently, in 2014, 68 percent of students met the English readiness standards with 67 percent doing so in math, the agency says.","We wondered what the percentages meant. They reflect student test results, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised, in keeping with a state law that requires college and universities to assess incoming high school graduates for their readiness to take college courses and offer remedial instruction as needed.","Under the program, called the Texas Success Initiative, the TEA has reported on the readiness of high-school students by calculating the share of students who meet related expectations on the state-mandated English language arts and math 11th grade\/exit-level Texas Assessment of Knowledge & Skills.","Asked if perhaps standards loosened between 2004 and 2013, Culbertson pointed out by email that in each of the years, a student classified as ready for college needed \"scale scores of 2200\" on each relevant TAKS including a 3 (out of a possible 4) on the writing portion of the English test.","To our inquiry, Shannon Housson, TEA director of performance reporting, said by phone the 124 percent and 54 percent respective improvements in students meeting the readiness standards over nine years reflected schools and students adjusting to and, in some cases, mastering the English and math TAKS, which were given from 2003 through 2011 before yielding to the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness.","At its inception, Housson said, the TAKS added up to a \"significant increase in rigor\" for students accustomed to the previous state-mandated exams. \"I remember the angst in the schools,\" Housson said, as teachers and others came to terms with the new focus on \"higher-order thinking skills\" linked to the state-set curriculum rather than simply academic skills.","Finally, Willett\u2019s citation of the2005 court decision on school financeled us to look back at how that opinion by Justice Nathan Hecht presented the percentages of students meeting the readiness standards. In the ruling, Hecht showed results for all students plus break-outs suggesting considerable performance lags among African American, Hispanic and Limited English Proficient students.","Results for 2013 suggest such gaps have closed quite a bit except among students the state deems English Language Learners.","Texas Students With Test Scores Suggesting College Readiness, 2004 and 2013","Subject","All Students","African-American","Hispanic","White","LEP\/ELL*","English (2004)","29%","19%","20%","36%","3%","Math (2004)","43%","21%","29%","56%","13%","English (2013)","65%","55%","60%","74%","14%","Math (2013)","61%","51%","55%","71%","12%","*Limited English Proficient\/English Language Learners","SAT, ACT scores","There are other ways to gauge college readiness.","In 2014, nearly 34 percent of the state\u2019s students who took the pre-college SAT (or 32 percent of public school students taking the test) did well enough to demonstrate a readiness for college work without remediation,according tothe College Board, which associates an SAT score of 1550 out of 2400 with a 65 percent probability of obtaining a first-year college GPA of B- or higher.","The same year, among 60 percent of 116,147 Texas high school graduates to take the ACT scored well enough to show a readiness for college English,the Iowa-based group says, with 47 percent doing so in math and 36 percent demonstrating readiness in science--and only 26 percent clearing all the tests\u2019 college-readiness benchmarks.

Katsma has referenced the Rainy Day Fund in the context of a conversation about income tax cuts, the point he is making is that the state government can afford to cut taxes because the government still has money left over even after making a new deposit in our \u2018savings account,\u2019\" Krueger said.","So, Katsma\u2019s numbers add up.","But in his claim is he offering the full picture?","Rainy Day Funds across the country","In 2017, state rainy day funds were at their highest overall level in almost 20 years, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers, with a tally of $54.7 billion for all 50 states.","Sounds like a lot.","ButPew Charitable Trustsreports that the $54.7 billion would only cover a median of 20.5 days, or 5.6 percent of general fund spending.","In 2017, Alaska, Wyoming and Texas were in the lead for how many days they could cover with a rainy day fund -- Alaska would be able to fund 376.6 days, Wyoming 366.9 days, Texas 70 days.","The four states coming at the bottom -- Montana, Kansas, Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- would be able to fund zero days relying on their rainy day funds.","Wisconsin fell on the lower end -- able to only fund six days using its rainy day fund.","With its total reserves, Wisconsin could fund up to 18.4 days. That compares to the national median of 30.3 days.","\"A typical reason you would want to have a rainy day fund is a recession appears, you weren\u2019t expecting it, and so you need to make up the revenues because of the recession, but I don\u2019t think any states have enough revenue set aside so you can make up for the entire recession,\" Holcombe said.","So while Wisconsin\u2019s fund may be at its peak, the figure does not compare favorably with other states.

But it\u2019s not the only one, and independent analysts say it\u2019s far from a sure thing that Medicare for All would save as much money as Gillum hopes it will.","The statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True."],"full_article":["Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has attracted national attention for his support for \"Medicare for All,\" an idea to expand the government-run Medicare health insurance program to cover everyone, rather than just Americans 65 and over.","Under the plan Gillum supports, individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone\u2019s medical bills. It's based on a bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.","On CNN\u2019s State of the Union, host Dana Bash asked Gillum about a George Mason University study that found Medicare for All could cost the government $33 trillion over 10 years. Bash asked whether Gillum be willing to tell Floridians they need to pay more in taxes to offset the costs.","\"Well, let me first say there was also a report, Dana, that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time,\" Gillum said during the Sept. 2, 2018interview.","We confirmed with Gillum\u2019s campaign that he and Bash were actually referring to the samereport\u2014 one published by the free-market-oriented Mercatus Center at George Mason University.","Both sides in the Medicare for All debate have seized upon aspects of the report to bolster their arguments.","Critics, including the author of the report, emphasized that the policy would bring a substantial fiscal burden. But supporters found fiscal hope. When Sanders previously said that the study indicated that enacting Medicare for All \"would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period,\" we rated that claimHalf True.","We thought that the issue was worth a fresh look with Gillum's defense, especially given some slight differences in his phrasing.","Medicare for All supporters say the proposal would not only increase health-insurance coverage to 100 percent but that the government could actually save money. The savings, they say, would come from eliminating the profits currently generated by health insurers, from taking advantage of economies of scale, and from being able to leverage lower prices on everything from prescription drugs to physician reimbursement fees.","Critics are skeptical that such savings would materialize, leaving taxpayers on the hook if they don't. They also worry about other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees.","To settle this debate, Medicare for All supporters flip to the page in the Mercatus report summarizing the financial effects of Sanders\u2019 bill.","The researchers looked at two main scenarios after implementation of the proposal.","One compared Mercatus\u2019 projection for the Sanders Medicare for All bill with what would be expected under a continuation of the current system (according to aDepartment of Health and Human Services\u2019 projection). With Medicare for All, the total amount of health care expenditures nationally would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years compared to the current system.","So Gillum can point to some evidence in the study that predicts savings. However, the Mercatus report\u2019s author, Charles Blahous, criticized that takeaway.","In an August interview with PolitiFact, Blahous said that estimate is based on a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders\u2019 plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payments will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent.","Blahous was more confident about an alternative scenario published in the report, in which cost-control works less effectively. Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law.","In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem.","In other words, there are a range of possible outcomes if Medicare for All is enacted, some supportive of Gillum\u2019s perspective and some not.","Independent health policy experts express caution before assuming large savings.","Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model that Gillum likes are \"not likely feasible,\" John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute, told us in August. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it\u2019s a \"pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically.\"","Christine Eibner, a health policy analyst with the RAND Corp., said that uncertainty makes it hard to predict the cost impact of Medicare for All, including whether administrative costs and reimbursements would decline or whether demand for health care services could be kept in check.","In a recentreportco-authored by Eibner that considered the impact of a single-payer model for New York state, RAND found that \"the estimated effects are highly dependent on the assumptions about provider payment rates, administrative costs, and drug prices.\""]}

Including others who arrived at legal ports of entry, a total of 22,110 minors showed up at the border without documents that month, she said.","But it\u2019s not accurate to describe either figure as the number of children being \"smuggled\" into the country, which Trump\u2019s supporters often link to drug cartels, \"coyotes\" or other bad actors.","While there were about 20,000 minors stopped while trying to enter the United States illegally, the number of children smuggled to the border probably was much smaller. That\u2019s because border officials screen for false claims of parentage or guardianship.","Between April and September 2018, Customs and Border Patrol separated 170 family units on suspicion of smuggling after determining that the child was not related to the parent or guardian, according toThe Washington Post.","But as FactCheck.org noted, 170 is a tiny percent of themore than 60,000 family unitsthat were apprehended during that time frame.

The plan also made more people eligible for the credit which increased the total granted to $4,000 for one qualifying individual and $8,000 total for two or more.","Biden\u2019s assertions, repeated by Sanders, are true in one regard: the projected poverty rate for 2021 would cut the rate by more than one-half. But we haven\u2019t been through the year to see whether or not the projection will be true.","A U.S. Census Bureau reportreleased Sept. 14showed the poverty rate for Americans under the age of 18 and younger was 16.1 percent in 2020. That is up from the Census Bureau report of 14.4 percent in poverty in 2019 but lower than any rate before 2019 since 16 percent in 1976.","In-depth reporting for the plan previously done by PolitiFact showed that the prediction was made using apoverty reduction analysis reportby Columbia University on Jan. 14, 2021.","The Columbia report predicted that the number of people under the age of 18 living in poverty would decrease 51.1 percent because of several proposed policy elements including the expanded Child Tax Credit. The analysis did not account for other policy elements that would impact policy rates like an increased minimum wage, child care assistance and rental assistance.","According to a July 28 report fromThe Urban Institute, a nonprofit researchorganization, the projected poverty rate for children in 2021 is 5.6%. Additionally, the report said that federal stimulus checks in general have a larger antipoverty impact than unemployment insurance or means-based benefits.","\"If all other programs were in place but the stimulus checks had not been paid, we project 12.4 million more people would be in poverty in 2021,\" the report said.","During the week ofMarch 14, 2020, the number of Iowa families who requested food and financial assistance increased by over 1,000 to 4,672. The same relative week a year before, 3,173 had sought the assistance. By the week of April 4, 2020, 7,342 families had requested assistance.","Alex Carfrae, Iowa Department of Human Services\u2019 public information officer, said that, while the American Rescue Plan is providing direct financial relief to Iowa families, it is too early to know whether or not child poverty in Iowa has dropped since the plan became law.","In 2019,12.8% of children in Iowawere experiencing poverty, That was down from 13.5% from the previous year.","Carfrae said the Department of Human Services does not keep track of poverty numbers in the state but rather through program utilization.","\"Many of the assistance programs that the DHS administers saw dramatic shifts in utilization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, making any analysis based on DHS programs or enrollment data challenging,\" Carfrae said."]}

That damaged public opinion of the law, making it a challenge to educate 43 million seniors on its nuances.","Enrollment in the law was set to begin in late 2005.

(In a comparable Kaiser poll in April 2013, 35 percent viewed the Affordable Care Act favorably and less than half felt they were well-informed of its details.)","The Medicare site, meant to help seniors pick benefit plans, was supposed to debut Oct. 13, 2005, but it didn\u2019tgo live until weeks later in November. Even then, \"the tool itself appeared to be in need of fixing,\" theWashington Postreportedat the time.","\"Visitors to the site could not access it for most of the first two hours. When it finally did come up around 5 p.m., it operated awfully slowly,\" thePostreported. (Sensing a pattern?)","Once seniors began to enroll, problems persisted. According to the report, the online tools had \"accuracy problems,\" and local organizations designated with assisting seniors \"reported problems getting necessary and accurate information.\" Call centers provided by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services underestimated \"the needed capacity to ensure that reliable answers could be provided\" and \"service representatives were not knowledgeable or failed to provide accurate information.\"","The Georgetown experts anticipated similar hiccups with the Affordable Care Act, noting that the country\u2019s experience with Medicare Part D suggested \"the experience will be far from perfect\" and \"problems were not always addressed as quickly or as thoroughly as critics would have liked, but fixes were usually found.\"","These days,nine in 10 seniors who utilize the program report they are satisfied with it.","\"There\u2019s really a striking amount of similarity even though this time it\u2019s a far larger and daunting task.

I don\u2019t remember a conversation at all blaming any IT people. This was about how do you really navigate through all these choices.\"","Meanwhile, most people who logged on to healthcare.gov in the opening weeks couldn\u2019t even get far enough to review what options were available.","Also, prescription drugs are a relatively small and easy-to-understand part of health care. Shopping for an insurance plan is more complicated.","\"For those who did choose to enroll (in Medicare Part D) online, they checked out their options by typing in drugs they used, and once you did, you got an estimated out-of-pocket cost to make your comparisons. In the exchange world you have a full health care benefit to buy,\" Hoadley said. \"The drug cost is relatively predictable, certainly a lot more predictable than overall health costs. The challenge for this website is a lot greater, probably by a significant amount of magnitude.\"","And there\u2019s the political climate as well. When Medicare Part D passed, Democrats were not happy with the final bill and were critical of its botched rollout. But even then, they were generally supportive of its intended outcome and worked with constituents who had difficulty signing up or utilizing their new benefits.","When Medicare Part D faced early troubles, many blue states came to its rescue.","The New York Timesreportedin 2006 that \"about 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program.\"","By contrast, not a single Republican voted for the Affordable Care Act, and in the years since it passed, the party has made its repeal a top priority. In the states, many Republican governors have bucked the Medicaid expansion and rejected offers to build their own insurance marketplaces, putting greater pressure on the federal government.","Henry Aaron, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute, said the opposition from Republicans has forced the Obama administration into a \"two-front war\" Bush did not have to fight.","\"On the one hand, one must and should address the administrative problems that no one denies is plaguing the problem,\" he said. \"But you\u2019re also waging a war of public opinion against the hysterics of its critics.\"","Our ruling"]}

I wanted to get that house to build a major building that would have employed a tremendous numbers of people, but when the woman didn\u2019t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it. So he\u2019s got me bulldozing down a house, I never bulldozed it down, it\u2019s false advertising.\"","Todd said, \"Well, all right, the accusation was that that\u2019s what you wanted to do.\"","Trump stood by his takedown: \"No, the accusation was that I did it, and I didn\u2019t do it.\"","It turns out that both Cruz and Trump are stretching the truth about what happened with a widow\u2019s home.","In this fact-check, we\u2019ll focus on Trump saying Cruz has \"got me bull-dozing down a house. I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising.\"","Donald vs. Vera","In a prior fact-check, we found Trump is sort of a poster boy for eminent domain (and he really did call the practice \"wonderful\" as recently as October.)","Eminent domain traditionally involves a proposal for a government-run project. However, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the 2005 caseKelo vs. New London, Conn.,said eminent domain could be used to make way for private commercial development. The court decided the development qualified as a public use because it would bring jobs and tax revenues to a blighted area.","Cruz\u2019s ad referencesa period in the 1990s, prior toKelo, when Trump wanted the state of New Jersey to use its eminent domain power to help him with a casino project. Trump planned to build a limousine garage to service the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City but several pieces of private property were in the way, including a home owned since the 1960s by a widow in her late 60s named Vera Coking.","Trumphas saidhe offered Coking millions for her property, but she wouldn\u2019t give up her home. In1994, New Jersey\u2019s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority threatened to use eminent domain to seize the house.","Thedisputeended up in front of a New Jersey court, whichruled againstTrump and the government in 1998. After losing the case, Trump gave up his plan to buy Coking\u2019s house, telling theNew York Daily Newsthat he was \"no longer an interested buyer.\"","\"The bottom line is it's too bad for Atlantic City, but it's not too bad for me because I'm not interested in the property,\" Trump said. \"Nobody gets under my skin.\"","Coking\u2019ssupporterspainted Trump as avillainous fat cat. Coking herself called him \"a maggot, a cockroach and a crumb.\"","Trump Plaza closed in September 2014after struggling financially.Trump toldtheNew York Timesthat ownership of Coking\u2019s property would not have saved it.","Back to Cruz\u2019s ad, Trump has a point that it is misleading to imply he got \"rich\" after bulldozing an elderly widow\u2019s home, given that Coking kept her property, and Trump never got anything out of it. But Trump exaggerated  when he said \"when the woman didn\u2019t want to sell, ultimately I just said forget about it.\" It took several years of failed negotiations and losing a lawsuit for him to decide he was no longer interested.","Our ruling"]}

The sheriff's published policy declares otherwise.","Still, did Hernandez declare that she wouldn\u2019t detain known criminals accused of violent crimes, as Abbott said?","Abbott offers no backup","We asked Abbott\u2019s office for the basis of his fresher claim and didn\u2019t hear back.","You could read the governor to have said that Hernandez, who was sworn in as sheriff in January 2017, put in place rules against keeping convicts accused of violent crimes behind bars \u2014 a broad unsupported charge given that the county continues to prosecute crimes of all kinds.","But in the context of Abbott's mention of \"sanctuary city policies,\" he surely was referring to Hernandez\u2019s announced policy, effective Feb. 1, 2017, that the county would no longer automatically grant requests by federal authorities to \"detain\" specified suspects for up to 48 hours so agents could investigate and possibly hasten deportation.","Hernandez,in her January 2017 announcement of the policy,said the department would honor ICE detainer requests only if an inmate was charged with or convicted of capital murder, murder, aggravated sexual assault or human smuggling \u2014 or if federal agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant for a suspect. Otherwise, inmates would be able to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status.","Hernandez saidbefore the policy took effect: \"Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated.\"","Policy says...","Let\u2019s look at the wording ofthe policy, then gauge whether, as Abbott said, Hernandez was saying she wouldn\u2019t detain known criminals charged with violent acts.","The policy states the sheriff\u2019s office \"shall comply with ICE detainer requests under the following circumstances: (a) when the detainer request is accompanied by a judicial warrant or court order for continued detention or notification, to the extent required by the judicial warrant or court order; or (b) when the individual who is the subject of the ICE detainer is charged with or has been convicted of the following felonies under Texas law: (1) Capital Murder, Tex.

Penal Code Sec. 20.06.\"","Separately, we noticed, the policy leaves wiggle room for the sheriff to hold inmates facing other charges. A portion states the office \"reserves the right to exercise discretion in any individual case to ensure that justice is served.\"","Policy in practice","When we asked the sheriff\u2019s office about Abbott\u2019s claim, spokeswoman Kristen Dark said by email that no inmates placed in the Travis County Jail \"will be released without making bond or having his or her charges disposed by a judge.\"","Abbott\u2019s description of the sheriff\u2019s detainer policy, Dark wrote, wasn\u2019t accurate because the policy provides for detainers to be granted automatically for several violent crimes and also gives the office discretion to \"ensure that justice is served.\"","Dark wrote: \"In each and every case,\" the office\u2019s \"command staff reviews an inmate\u2019s current charge\/s as well as criminal history. If there is any indication of violence in that data, the ICE Detainer Request is honored,\" she said.","A spreadsheet","We asked Dark if the agency had recently analyzed when jail personnel approved or rejected ICE detainer requests. In reply, Dark emailed us aspreadsheet, covering department decisions from March 1, 2017 through May 5, 2017, which she described as its May 5, 2017, response to an open-records request by KUT News.","The sheet doesn\u2019t show past convictions for any crimes, so we didn\u2019t see a way to reach conclusions about individuals not being detained despite their criminal histories.","But what about letting individuals go despite current violent-crime charges?","Over the two-plus months, according to the sheet, ICE detainer requests were approved by the department for around 200 individuals charged with crimes, with many individuals listed as remaining in jail. Charges filed against the detainer-approved individuals include sexual abuse of a child; manslaughter; aggravated sexual assault; and driving while intoxicated, according to the sheet.","The sheet identifies 15 individuals already released to ICE in response to detainer requests. Related charges include DWI; assault causing bodily injury; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (two men); terroristic threat of a family member; manufacture of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver; possession of marijuana; burglary of a habitation; sexual indecency with a child; and aggravated sexual assault of a child.","On the flip side, the sheet lists about 90 individuals mostly released by the county after detainer requests were denied.","Many of the people were arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated or possessing small amounts of marijuana, neither of which would necessarily signal a violent crime.","We counted nine individuals among the 90 who were each arrested for an alleged assault causing bodily injury to a family member--domestic violence, Dark told us by phone. Eight of these inmates were released on personal recognizance bonds, the sheet states, after the sheriff declined to approve a detainer requested by ICE; the ninth was released by a judge\u2019s order, the sheet says.","We asked Dark about the rationale for declining detainers on those individuals. By email, Dark replied: \"The nature of the behavior that resulted in the arrests was not aggravated and therefore, did not meet the threshold required for\" the office to automatically \"honor the ICE detainer request.\" Dark said by phone that further research revealed that five of the individuals had previously been released to ICE, possibly even deported.","Dark\u2019s email said: \"If ICE has past experience with the individuals, they should know the status and be able to quickly get a warrant or court order. If presented with a warrant,\" the sheriff\u2019s office \"would gladly have turned these inmates over to ICE upon the disposition of their charges by a judge,\" Dark said.","The sheet shows too that a man who allegedly made a terroristic threat was released on a personal recognizance bond after the sheriff denied a detainer request. Dark said by email the individual had allegedly told a security guard at a bar, \"I\u2019m going to shoot you.\" Dark said no weapon was found in his possession.","Our ruling"]}

But a2017 reportfrom the Wisconsin Policy Forum (then the Public Policy Forum) listed Wisconsin among the states with no local sales tax power, since only counties have that ability and it\u2019s capped at 0.5%.","That policy forum report noted this has caused increasing problems in Milwaukee:","\"Wisconsin\u2019s strong state aid historically has compensated for the lack of local revenue diversity. However, cutbacks in shared revenue have diminished this program\u2019s purchasing power and required Milwaukee to lean heavily on increased property taxes and fees to offset the impact.\"","A2019 policy forum reportsaid stagnant shared revenue combined with state caps on property taxes has led to mounting questions about \"whether local officials can sustain appropriate service levels in areas such as public safety, streets, libraries and parks.\"","This brings us to Barrett\u2019s more specific claim \u2014 that Milwaukee is the only city of 400,000 or more in the nation without a local sales or income tax.","The2017 reportfrom the Wisconsin Policy Forum compared Milwaukee to 38 peer cities around the country. They reported 30 of those cities had a general local sales tax, and the remaining eight each drew revenue from a \"selective sales taxes and\/or other forms of taxation besides the property tax.\"","That report excluded cities like Indianapolis and Boston from the comparison since they have different funding mechanisms than Milwaukee. Indianapolis performs some typical county functions, and Boston has school district funds pass through its budget.","We asked Barrett\u2019s office for details on where his claim originated, and they forwarded us to Jeff Fleming, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Department of City Development. He said Barrett\u2019s claim was based on that policy forum report.","But Barrett referred to cities by size, not to the limited peer group in the study. And that makes a difference.","Boston has a population well over 400,000 and does not have a local sales tax or income tax, according to anAugust 2019 reportfrom the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning.","We\u2019ll assume Barrett was referring to cities that don\u2019t levy their own local sales tax, since otherwise Milwaukee wouldn\u2019t meet his criteria given that city residents are subject to the county\u2019s local sales tax.","And in that case other cities join Boston on the list of exceptions to Barrett\u2019s claim.","Indianapolis does not levy its own sales or income tax, but Marion County imposes a local income tax there, according to the Tax Foundation. And Portland, Oregon, has no city-issued sales or income tax, but residents there pay an income tax to a regional transportation district."]}

Roy Blunt has once again echoed his reasoning for supporting a repeal.","\"This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges,\"the Republican said in a Jan. 11 press release.\"Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options.\"","It\u2019s not the first time Blunthas mentioned the numbers, which his office noted were fromHealthCare.gov(the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 website where individuals can enroll in health care).","As insurance providers pull out of markets and premiums rise around the country, the health care exchange is certainly facing substantial changes. Even in that context, though, Blunt\u2019s figures paint a drastic picture for Missourians, and we wanted to fact-check his statement.","97 out of 114 counties","On the numbers, Blunt is correct. Ninety-seven Missouri counties will only have one insurance provider offering coverage on the health care exchange this year, according to data compiled and released by the official exchange provider,HealthCare.gov, and synthesized by theMissouri Hospital Associationand theKaiser Family Foundation.","Fifteen counties and the city of St. Louis will have two providers, and two counties that include large swaths of Kansas City will have three.","In 2016, 112 Missouri counties and the city of St. Louis all had at least three insurance providers participating in the health care exchange. No county had only one.","The reduction in coverage is primarily the result of two major insurance providers exiting the individual state exchange at the beginning of the year. The providers, UnitedHealth Group and Aetna (known in Missouri as Coventry Health Care), are both staying in the state in other markets, but have opted out of participating in the exchange.","\"I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s impacting care as much as it\u2019s impacting the ability to choose the provider you want,\" said Dave Dillon, vice president of public and media relations at the Missouri Hospital Association. In essence, he explained, it\u2019s possible for an individual not to have the option to choose a plan that would allow them to visit their regular doctor.","With this lack of choices, Dillon said, \"clearly the incentive between insurance companies to compete in cost just isn\u2019t there.\"","During the open enrollment period, which ran from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31,nearly 250,000 Missouriansenrolled in some form of insurance provided by the health care law.","Metropolitan areas continue to have choice","One notable feature of Missouri\u2019s insurance exchange in 2017 is that all of the counties in the state\u2019s two metropolitan hubs, Kansas City and St. Louis, will continue to have more than one provider.","According to theU.S. Census Bureau, of Missouri\u2019s roughly 6 million residents, about 63 percent live in the 17 counties and one city that will continue to have at least two provider choices.","Nationally, according to theKaiser Family Foundation, the trend is similar. Of exchange enrollees living in metropolitan areas, 62 percent will continue to have a choice of three or more providers while only 18 percent will have the option of only one provider.","For those living in rural areas, the numbers are almost reversed. Forty-one percent of those enrolled in the exchange living in rural areas will have only one provider option while 29 percent will have three or more options.","The out-of-pocket price","In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent\" \u2014 is also statistically accurate, according to the Missouri Hospital Association and the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, it does not accurately portray the out-of-pocket price Missourians will face in 2017.","While premiums are on the rise in Missouri, as they are in the rest of the country, so, too, are the tax credits designed to offset the cost that the consumer bears.","Speaking on the increases in price on the exchange this year, Dillon said, \"The individual was not exposed to the full cost of the increase of the sticker price.\" The rhetoric surrounding premium increases often looks only at the sticker price and not the out-of-pocket price, he said.","Again using data fromHealthCare.gov, the Missouri Hospital Association compiled the costs of premiums both before and after the tax credit in the 10 Missouri health insurance marketplace rating areas.","Looking strictly at the second lowest-cost silver plan, which is the plan used byHealthCare.govto determine the financial assistance an individual or family may receive, eight of the ten counties will see an out-of-pocket monthly price of $26.52. Data for the other two counties was unavailable.","So while premiums for the second lowest cost silver plan in each of the eight counties rose in 2017, the out-of-pocket cost saw a change of less than one percent \u2014 less than a dollar.","Our ruling"]}

The effect has been a cancellation of a cadet class and the dissolution of some law enforcement units.","In a June 3 interview with the Daily Signal, a conservative news site published by the Heritage Foundation, the Texas Republican argued that these changes have led to \"a doubling of murder\" that has been harmful to the city\u2019s Black and Latino communities.","Instead, cities should be increasing their law enforcement presence at the ground level to ensure that officers build relationships in their communities, he argued.","\"Why are we going the other way?\" Roy said. \"(Austin leaders say) 'Oh, let's reimagine police by getting rid of them.' What do you have? You have a doubling of murder in Austin, Texas. It's insane.\"","\"That's not good for the communities that are allegedly being helped,\" Roy said.","The City Council\u2019s decision to cut its police budget following massive protests in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death has already drawn scorn from the state\u2019s Republican leaders. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, for instance, said that the cuts made Austin \"one of the most dangerous cities in America and definitely in Texas.\" We rated that claimPants on Fire.","More than 20 major U.S. cities slashed police budgets in the aftermath of 2020\u2019s nationwide protests against police brutality. Austin\u2019s cuts, which amounted to about one-third of its police department\u2019s 2020 budget, were the largest in the nation.","It\u2019s now been eight months since Austin\u2019s police budget cuts went into effect. Have murders in the city doubled since then?","It\u2019s not entirely clear what Roy is comparing this year\u2019s homicide numbers to. His office didn\u2019t provide answers to several questions. But since he tied the cause of the rise to police budget cuts, we can infer he\u2019s comparing this year\u2019s levels to the year prior \u2014 before and after the cuts took effect.","We found that homicides so far this year are close to doubling the number recorded this time last year. According to monthly crime stats posted by the Austin Police Department, the city has recorded 33 murders from January through the end of May. Last year the city recorded 19 murders in the same five-month span. That\u2019s a 74% increase.","But this increase paints a far more dramatic picture than the reality on the ground, experts say. Using a percentage increase to compare small numbers can give the impression of dramatic changes.","For instance, the city of El Paso recorded two homicides in the first quarter of 2020 and five homicides in the first quarter of 2021 \u2014 a 150% increase.","By comparison, the city of Houston recorded 16 more murders in the first quarter of 2021 than the first quarter of 2020. But because Houston\u2019s total homicides is a much larger number, 94 in the first quarter of 2021, the 16 additional murders results in a much smaller percentage increase \u2014 20%.","Gov. Greg Abbott also has used percentage increase figures to emphasize Austin\u2019s crime numbers in his criticisms of police defunding. We rated that claimHalf True.","\"I\u2019ve always been told: don\u2019t use percentages for numbers that are under 50. If you\u2019re looking at 30 or 45, don\u2019t use a percentage difference because the percentage changes are so big,\" St. Edward's University criminologist Carsten Andresen said last year.","Because Austin\u2019s homicide totals are low figures, comparing the homicide increase in that way isn\u2019t seen by criminologists as an appropriate characterization.","Any way you measure it, Austin homicide levels are elevated so far this year. But are these numbers high because of the Police Department\u2019s budget cuts?","\"It\u2019s fair to say that violent crime has increased in Austin \u2014 and everywhere else,\" said Texas State criminologist Sean Roche.","According to a report released by the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which combines crime data of 63 metropolitan areas across the U.S., homicides are up by 30% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020.","In many cities, homicides upticks have occurred despite increases in police funding since last year. Houston increased Police Department funding by adding $20 million to its nearly $1 billion budget, yet saw a 20% increase in murders in the first quarter of the year. Both Dallas and Fort Worth also increased law enforcement funding while recording upticks in homicides in the first quarter of this year.","Experts say it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to draw a direct correlation between fluctuations in police funding and crime rates when so many sociological factors are at play, the ongoing pandemic not least among them.","\"Say the police are pulling back a little bit. Does that really affect how individual people decide whether to commit murder? We know that a lot of violence is in the moment \u2014 it's not a cold-blooded decision,\" Roche said. \"Are a lot of people really going, 'normally I wouldn't try to shoot or knife this person, but I've heard that the police are defunding, so I've decided that murder is the right decision'?\"","What is behind increased violent crime rates in Austin and across the nation? Crime trends often are influenced by macro-level drivers, especially during a pandemic. A cocktail of increased unemployment, the gun-buying surge, increased alcohol consumption and drug use can all combine to drive crime rates up. Unmeasurable factors, like civil unrest and political stress, also are in the mix.","All of these factors combined to make 2020 a year of high crime, and many of those factors are still present, Roche said. It\u2019s unclear how or if those crime trends will abate as increased vaccination causes the pandemic to recede."]}

The top corporate rate will fall from 35 percent to 21 percent, and the business version of the alternative minimum tax will be repealed.","Gwin cited a 2017chartby the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that shows tax receipts as a percentage of GDP dating back to 1934. The chart is based on historical tables from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.","Gwin said Cordray\u2019s point wasn\u2019t to make comparisons between individual years such as 1967 and 2017 since the numbers fluctuate from year to year, but to make a larger point that over the last 50 years individuals have contributed an increasing share of overall tax revenue, while corporations have paid a decreasing share.","Since Cordray mentioned looking back 50 years, we will use 1967 and 2017 as our comparison years, though it wouldn\u2019t change dramatically if we looked at different years in that general range.","In 1967, individual income taxes accounted for 7.3 percent of gross domestic product while corporate income taxes accounted for 4.1 percent. The center\u2019s estimate for 2017 shows that individual income taxes now represent a larger share -- 9.3 percent -- while the corporate share has fallen to 2.2 percent.","Joel Slemrod, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, said the comparison is broadly accurate -- however, to get to the 5 percent for the corporate tax that Cordray cited would require going back a bit further than 50 years, to 1954. He also said that Cordray\u2019s numbers only apply to federal taxes.","Since the United States has had a high corporate tax rate, millions of mid-sized businesses that would have paid the corporate tax have instead used alternative structures to lower their taxes.","That resulted in a huge amount of business income shifting from corporations to so-called pass-through entities, said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.","\"If you look at data the past couple of decades there has been a huge rise in LLCs\" and other such entities, Edwards said. \"About half of all business income in the U.S. is those pass-through entities that don\u2019t pay the corporate income tax -- they pay through the individual income tax code.\"","The business-backedTax Foundationcompiled data showing the decrease in the number of corporations subject to the corporate income tax and the increase in S corporations paying the individual income tax.","Between 1980 and 2012, the number of corporations subject to the corporate income tax fell from 2.2 million to 1.6 million. Meanwhile, the number of S corporations subject to the individual income tax increased from 0.5 million to 4.2 million, with the number of non-corporate businesses increasing dramatically as well, said Scott Greenberg, senior analyst at the Foundation.","In 2012, pass-through businesses earned $1.63 trillion in net income, compared to $1.10 trillion of net income earned by C corporations -- the traditional kind of corporation that pays corporate taxes.","\"As a result, focusing on the corporate income tax, as an indicator for how much American businesses (or even American corporations) are paying in taxes, can be quite misleading,\" Greenberg said. \"Because many businesses have switched away from the C corporate form, and are now taxed under the individual income tax, the comparison between corporate income tax revenue 50 years ago and today is not quite apples-to-apples.\""]}

Budget resolutions also don\u2019t affect Social Security \u2014 at least not directly \u2014 becausethere are rules against it, Van de Water said.","Sinema\u2019s team pointed to McSally and Sinema\u2019s stance on transitioning Medicare to the Republican-favored \"premium support\" program, or \"vouchers\" as Democrats critically call it.","Under the premium support\/voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. Agoalof switching over to the premium support\/voucher approach is to reduce the growth in Medicare spending.Arguments against the switchinclude concerns that it would shift more costs to beneficiaries over time.","Van de Water told PolitiFact that a premium support\/voucher system would in most cases make traditional Medicare more expensive relative to theMedicare Advantage Plans(Medicare plans offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare). It\u2019s fair to say that voting for a premium support\/voucher system would be, at least in principle, a vote for cuts in Medicare, Van de Water said.","McSally has cast votes for motions and resolutions that would support a premium support\/voucher program or restructure Social Security, and raise the retirement age, Sinema\u2019s team said, pointing toroll-calls andmediareports.","Sinema\u2019s campaign also said that in 2013, Sinema and other lawmakers wrote to former President Barack Obama urging him to reject any budget proposal that would raise the retirement age or cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits, specifically mentioning \"Chained CPI\" (an inflation adjustment measure).","As PolitiFact Florida reported, a proposal to use chained CPI for inflation would not have lowered seniors\u2019 Social Security checks, but their checks would have grown at a slower rate.","The impact of the proposal would have depended upon the particulars in any separate legislation that became law, PolitiFact Florida found in a similar gubernatorial race fact-check.","Sinema\u2019s campaign also said McSally voted in favor of the tax cuts Trump signed into law late 2017 (Sinema voted against), saying they will lower Medicare and Social Security\u2019s projected revenue. We\u2019ve ratedHalf Trueclaimslinking the tax cuts to Medicare and Social Security\u2019s future payments. The tax cuts are projected to increase the deficit, and some Republicans have called for entitlement reform to address it. Experts say that potential changes or \"cuts\" to Medicare and Social Security would not be just because of the tax cuts. The programs already are on an unsustainable trajectory.","While it's common for a candidate to attack another for trying to do anything to bring the systems into balance, the bottom line is that either Congress will have to slow the growth of the program, raise taxes, or both.","Asked about Sinema\u2019s position to ensure the program's financial viability in the future, her campaign didn\u2019t give specifics, saying only that Sinema \"believes we need to protect Medicare and Social Security benefits, weed out waste, fraud and abuse, and work together to ensure that the program is able to fulfill its long-term commitments to current and future retirees.\"","There are instances where McSally\u2019s and Sinema\u2019s votes aligned.","Sinema in April 2015 voted for a motion instructing House conferees to agree with the Senate in preventing Medicare from becoming a \"voucher program,\" Sinema\u2019s campaign said. The roll call showsMcSally voted the same way.","Both lawmakers in October 2017 alsovoted against a budget proposalthat called for \"slashing trillions from domestic and foreign-affairs programs and entitlements including Medicare and Medicaid, repealing the Affordable Care Act and changing Social Security,\"Tucson.com reported.","McSally\u2019s campaign did not push back on Sinema\u2019s claims about McSally\u2019s record. Instead, it spotlighted Sinema\u2019s own record.","One example McSally\u2019s campaign provided:Sinema in April 2018 voted in favorof a \"balanced-budget amendment,\" which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosidescribed as\"an act of breathtaking hypocrisy and an open assault on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,\" and one \"purpose-built to force devastating cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\"","McSally also voted in favor of the proposal. It did not pass.","While Sinema\u2019s team said her website\u2019s claim was only directed toward McSally, other candidates in the race, including Republicans Ward and Arpaio, told PolitiFact they opposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and raising the retirement age. Sinema\u2019s Democratic opponent in the primary, civil rights attorneyDeedra Abboud, also said she was against cuts to seniors\u2019 benefits or raising the retirement age."]}

The data McCain\u2019s staff had at the time of his appearance onFace the Nationshowed that through the end of March, there had been 2,950 strikes out of 12,121 strike-sorties, or 24 percent.

(Strike-sorties do not include support flights, such as those for surveillance or tanker refuelings.)","We double-checked with the Pentagon, and two officials said that McCain got his numbers right.","As of May 27, 2015, the United States had flown approximately 15,600 strike-sorties resulting in approximately 4,198 strikes, said Cmdr. Elissa Smith, a spokeswoman with the Office of the Secretary of Defense. That works out to 27 percent -- slightly higher than the data McCain had, but close enough for our purposes.","Pentagon officials told PolitiFact that there was nothing unusual or surprising about that ratio.","\"The fact that aircraft go on missions and don't strike anything is not out of the norm,\" said Air Force Capt. Andrew \"Ender\" Caulk of Air Forces Central Command Public Affairs. Despite U.S. strikes being \"the most precise in the history of warfare,\" Caulk said, \"conducting strike operations in the heavily populated areas where DAESH hides presents challenges. We are fighting an enemy who goes out of their way to put civilians at risk. However, the vast majority of pilots understand the need for the tactical patience in this environment. This fight against DAESH is not the kind of fight from previous decades.\"","Caulk added that if the United States engaged \"the way some of these 'critics' want us to, we would be operating in violation of agreements established between the coalition nations and Iraq and putting civilians and Iraqi forces at greater risk.

They point to larger market forces that affect prices, including the relatively high worldwide supply of oil. Plus, they note, most oil passing through the Keystone would have been exported, so Americans wouldn\u2019t be the ones paying for it.","Less pipeline capacity likely means Canadian oil producers have to use rail more to transport oil to refiners. But they would be under competitive pressure to absorb the added costs of that rather than passing them on, said Richard Masson, chairman of the World Petroleum Council Canada and an executive fellow at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy.","\"This is because U.S. refiners, particularly on the Gulf Coast where KXL was aimed, have the ability to import crude from tankers, and therefore pay the global price for it,\" he said. \"If Canadian crude was to get more expensive than global crudes on tankers, the U.S. refiners would shift to a higher level of tanker imports.\"","Hakes said most analysts believe that delivery by rail is somewhat more expensive than delivery by pipeline, \"but the difference is slight and transportation of crude oil to refineries is a very small part of the overall cost of gasoline at the pump. That is why, if the argument is that motorists will see a difference in purchase prices, it is highly dubious.\"","Moreover, the world can currently produce much more oil than is needed to meet demand, so \"I am confident that the cancellation or delay of the Keystone pipeline would not have any impact on gasoline prices at the pump,\" Hakes said.","Global demand for oil has been depressed over the past year by economic slowdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Economics professor Robert Godby, deputy director of the University of Wyoming's Center for Energy Regulation and Policy, said oil prices are set in world markets and \"we don\u2019t suffer from supply constraints in this country that raise the cost of oil.\"","The Keystone XL \"could have alleviated some local and regional pipeline bottlenecks in the upper Midwest and northern Rocky Mountain region, but overall should not have been expected to lower oil or gasoline prices in the U.S.,\" he said.","Keystone XL was not designed to supply the U.S. market, but to deliver oil from Canada mainly for export to foreign markets, said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen.

Guess who voted to eliminate it.\"","When Feingold was asked by reporters to elaborate, he said Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers who were eligible for the program.","Is Feingold right?","How the program works","The Trade Adjustment Assistance program dates to the 1970s and was created to help workers who lost their jobs -- or whose wages or hours have been cut -- because of foreign competition. The program, in part, offers displaced workers temporary benefits and pays to train them with new skills so they can find a new job.","In Wisconsin, the federal government has spent nearly $220 million in the last six years for worker benefits and training, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. That includes money for enhancedvocational training through the state\u2019s technical collegesin programs such as information technology, healthcare and manufacturing.","Proponents of the TAA program say it can lessen the blow of job losses that occur when companies move operations overseas to reduce labor costs \u2014 a practice that critics contend is facilitated by free trade agreements the United States has struck with other countries.","Johnson has voiced general support for free trade, while Feingold voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement when he was a U.S. senator andhas opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.","Feingold\u2019s claim has two parts:","Did Johnson specifically cite the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a defense of trade agreements?","When we asked Feingold\u2019s campaign for backup, officials pointed to a statement Johnson made in aMay 2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article: \"Free trade does help all economies. And there are dislocations. There are protections against those dislocations. We all support being able to help workers that have been displaced.\"","Despite what Feingold said, Johnson did not explicitly refer to the TAA in that statement. Rather he voiced general support for helping displaced workers.","Indeed, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us the TAA is \"ineffective and duplicative\" and in need of \"major reforms.\"","Johnson\u2019s campaign also pointed to aHouse Budget Committee reportthat said the federal government has other forms of aid, including at least 35 job training programs among eight departments and agencies.","There are \"dozens of programs to help people who need assistance,\" Reisinger said.","Did Johnson vote to eliminate the Trade Adjustment Assistance program?","Johnson voted in September 2011against a bill to reauthorize the program,although the measure passed despite his opposition.","Feingold also noted that Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers eligible for TAA help.","Thosegrantswerepart of the 2009 economic stimulus package, which was approved before Johnson was in office. ButJohnson voted for legislation in 2011that would have reduced TAA spending to pre-2009 levels; that proposal also failed.","At the time, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona,said he offered the measurebecause of concerns with TAA\u2019s effectiveness andbecause stimulus spending was supposed to be temporary.","Our rating"]}

Rick Scott wants Florida lawmakers torevisit the 2011 elections overhaul, which was widely blamed for problems with early voting during last year\u2019s presidential election.In an interview on Miami-based WPLG Channel 10, Scott stressed he wants local supervisors to have the option to implement the most early voting hours in Florida history.\"What I think we ought to be doing is give the flexibility to our supervisors of elections, most of them, as you know, are elected county by county, but say you can do anywhere from eight to 14 days, six to 12 hours a day,\" Scott said in the Jan. 18, 2013, interview, \"so a potential of 168 hours, which I think is the most we\u2019ve ever had.\"Scott, who refused to extend early voting in 2012 despite long lines at some polls, is also calling on the Legislature to restore early voting on the Sunday before Election Day -- the day when African-American groups hosted popular \"Souls to the Polls\" events.Here we\u2019ll examine whether Scott is right to say his proposal would be the most hours for early voting.Florida\u2019s history with early voting is short.Former Gov. Jeb Bush signed early voting into law in 2004. That law required early voting to start15 days before an election, with at least eight hours per weekday and eight hours total for each weekend. Voters had 104 early voting hours.Even though election supervisors asked for more hours and more locations, Bush and the GOP-led Legislature passed a newlawin 2005 that reduced hours and confined voting to election offices, city halls and libraries. Under the new law, early voting lasted 14 days, for eight hours on weekdays and a total of eight hours on the weekend. That\u2019s 96 hours.In the 2008 presidential election, voters had more time to vote earlythanks to an emergency extensionordered by Gov. Charlie Crist (read thatexecutive order.) Many news accounts put the total number of early voting hours in 2008 at 120, but the Department of State calculates it at 116.In 2011, the Legislature passed a sweepingelections lawthat reduced the amount of days for early voting from 14 to eight. The new law gave supervisors a choice of offering between between six and 12 hours of early voting each day. (Here\u2019s a relatedcheckon that.) So local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days.The Legislature is poised to tweak the state\u2019s early voting system again in 2013 because of the long waits to vote in some places during the 2012 presidential election.Scott, echoing proposals from the elections supervisors association, recommended the Legislature give supervisors the ability to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting, while maintaining six to 12 hours each day. He also wants to add more early voting sites.So under Scott\u2019s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). On the flip side, the fewest number of hours they would be required to offer is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours).Activists behind the liberal campaign Pink Slip Rick disapproved of Scott\u2019s proposal, saying Scott should have restored the number of days for early voting to 14, the way it was before the 2011 election law.\"Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting,\" said Amy Ritter, executive director of Florida Watch Action, the liberal group behind Pink Slip Rick.A few election supervisors we interviewed about Scott\u2019s plan said they welcomed the idea of tailoring early voting to their home county\u2019s needs.\"We kind of came to the conclusion that obviously, with Florida being such a huge and diverse state, one size does not fit all,\" said Brian Corley, Pasco County supervisor of elections.Corley, who heads up legislative affairs for the state supervisors association, said he does not think Pasco would need the full 168 hours, but \"it\u2019s nice to have the option, if need be, for a major presidential election.\"A spokeswoman for Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes said her office had not yet begun planning for the scenario under Scott\u2019s plan but would probably go back to 14 days of early voting, the way things were before the Legislature\u2019s 2011 law.\"We would likely conduct early voting as it was structured prior to HB 1355,\" said public services director Mary Cooney in an email.Our ruling"]}

The candidates controlled by (House Speaker Michael) Madigan, all of them have said, \u2018The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike,\u2019 \" Rauner said, referring to Democratic candidates Daniel Biss, Chris Kennedy and JB Pritzker.","All three have stated they support replacing Illinois\u2019 flat-rate income tax with a system in which those with higher incomes pay higher rates.",".@GovRauner: \"The candidates controlled by Madigan, all of them have said, \u2018The answer to our problems is a massive income tax hike.'\"https:\/\/t.co\/hfE82jW574#twill#ilgov","Rauner went on to list examples of other states \u2014 New Jersey, New York, Minnesota and California \u2014 where people earning $40,000 a year pay more in state income tax than the 4.95 percent rate now applied to all Illinois taxpayers.","\"They will sock the middle class with a tax hike that Madigan and his puppets want and it will destroy Illinois,\" Rauner said, noting that the progressive tax movement would be deceptively labeled as a \"tax the rich\" effort.","We strongly support a progressive income tax in our state to ensure that Illinois public schools are fully funded, so that every child gets a quality education no matter where they live.","Rauner\u2019s statement contained a generous dollop of campaign vitriol \u2014 the Madigan-as-puppet-master theme is a running theme for Rauner \u2014 but it also brings up what is sure to be another key issue in the governor\u2019s race. Would a Democratic victory for governor next year bring about a graduated-rate income tax for Illinois? And would that be tantamount to a \"massive income tax hike?\"","Rauner\u2019s statement implies a Democratic governor could muscle through a change that would replace Illinois\u2019 current flat-rate income tax system with a multi-rate system. That overlooks the fact that the single-rate income tax is enshrined in the Illinois Constitution of 1970, establishing a high hurdle for enacting any change.","\"A tax on or measured by income shall be at a non-graduated rate,\" beginsArticle IX, Section 3of the constitution.","To impose a progressive tax system lawmakers would have to amend the constitution. That requires approval of three-fifths majorities in both the Illinois House and Senate to put the issue on a general election ballot. Then voters must approve the amendment by \"either three-fifths of those voting on the question or a majority of those voting inthe election,\" according toArticle XIV, Section 2of the constitution.","From 2013 to 2017, Democrats held three-fifths majorities in both the House and Senate yet stillcould not muster votesto back ballot referendums on a limited graduated income tax plan to impose higher rates on the very rich.","Since then, Democrats have lost their three-fifths margin in the House, though they control the chamber. In theory that could change in the next election, but to push through a tax referendum in the House before then would require a handful of Republican votes. And that\u2019s not likely to happen.","The governor, incidentally, is irrelevant in this process. There is no veto power over constitutional amendments. If approved by voters, they become law.","Under the constitution, the only path to get a tax referendum before voters is through the Legislature. Citizen-led petition drives for such a purpose are not allowed.","Rauner also equates a graduated tax system to a \"massive tax increase\" on the middle class.","But he tries to make the point with cherry-picked examples.","A single filer earning $40,000 annually in California pays 6 percent. It\u2019s 5.525 percent in New Jersey, 6.45 percent in New York and 7.05 percent in Minnesota, according to 2017 tax data compiled byThe Tax Foundation. Those tax rates are all higher than the 4.95 percent now imposed on Illinois taxpayers.","But there are other graduated income tax states Rauner failed to cite where the numbers would undermine his premise.","Individuals earning $40,000 a year pay 3.36 percent under Arizona\u2019s graduated-rate system. In Maryland, those who earn between $3,000 and $100,000 pay 4.75 percent. North Dakota taxes $40,000 at 2.04 percent, and its highest bracket imposes only a 2.9 percent rates on incomes over $416,700. Ohio\u2019s top rate, 4.997 percent, applies to income of more than $210,600. Those in Ohio earning $40,000 pay 2.969 percent. Even Connecticut\u2019s 5-percent tax on $40,000 is very close to Illinois\u2019 4.95 percent. (Connecticut\u2019s top bracket, 6.99 percent, kicks in at $500,000 for individual filers.)","While Democratic candidates say they support a graduated-rate system, they have been talking in the abstract and none have proposed specific rates. Given the difficulty of amending the constitution, lawmakers would be loath to enshrine tax and income brackets into it, and any rate-setting would fall to the legislature after a constitutional change.","The realpolitik of that hasn\u2019t stopped Rauner from predicting how it would all play out. \"They say, \u2018Let\u2019s tax the rich,\u2019\" Rauner said in the same Dec. 4 press conference. \"Well, first of all, you watch business owners flood out of this state when that happens and our unemployment rate is going to go through the roof.\"","The last big push for a comprehensiveprogressive tax amendmentcame during the 2013-14 legislative session and itdied without receiving a votein either the House or Senate. The proposal contained no income or tax bracket figures.","In 2012, the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning fiscal watchdog, created aprogressive tax modelin which taxpayers with incomes of less than $100,000 \u2014 94 percent of those in Illinois \u2014 would pay the same or less than the 5 percent tax rate in effect at that time. The model nonetheless projected a 5.8 percent increase in revenue from the income tax because of higher rates on the wealthiest Illinoisans.","CTBA Budget Director Bobby Otter said that model would likely hold up today because the current Illinois tax rate, 4.95 percent, is close to that used to make the projection.","Raising taxes is never easy, but procedurally it is easier to change rates than change the constitution. Indeed, the Illinois tax rate has bounced around in recent years, from 5 percent in 2010 to 3.75 percent in 2015 to 4.95 percent starting last summer.","When we contacted Rauner\u2019s campaign to ask whether the Republican believed a Democratic successor would try to raise the latest rate, spokesman Justin Giorgio referred us to a recent column inThe News-Gazette of Champaign-Urbana.","That column focused on reporting byCrain\u2019s Chicago businessabout a Nov. 20 visit by Pritzker to its editorial board. During that visit, the Democrat mentioned a progressive income tax and potentially new tax revenue for the state if it legalized marijuana. Pritzker was not quoted as directly calling for a tax hike:","Some will come from amending the Illinois Constitution to allow a progressive income tax, something that would require a referendum vote, likely in 2020. Pritzker said he could not estimate how much that would pull in, but he projected the state would net another $300 million to $700 million by legalizing and taxing marijuana.Would that be enough to meet all the needs while (economic) growth accelerates?\"No. But it depends on how you prioritize,\" Pritzker replied.","After the meeting, a Pritzker campaign spokeswoman issued a statement to clarify that \"J.B. does not believe we should raise taxes on middle-class families, period.\"","In sum, Pritzker backs a graduated tax amendment, thinks it will reap more revenue for the state and acknowledges that still may not be sufficient to meet needs. But his spokeswoman suggests only the wealthy should be asked to pay more. (The article cited by the Rauner campaign discussed only Pritzker, though Biss and Kennedy have endorsed the progressive tax concept.)"]}

As he said, children can\u2019t be jailed with their parents. But that\u2019s true in any situation in which a parent is sent to jail.","However, the agreement doesn't mandate the separations occurring on the border, which have stepped up due to a Trump administration change in enforcement policy.

Click here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check."],"full_article":["Ted Cruz said a court order prevents children from staying with immigrating parents who are jailed at the U.S.-Mexico border.","A reader asked us if that\u2019s so.","Cruz, the Texas Republican seeking re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2018, said inan interviewaired June 11, 2018, that when Barack Obama was president, families entering the country were able to stay together because adults were released rather than detained. For longer than that, immigrants entering the country illegally as families wererarely criminally prosecuted, and many parents and children were placed in family detention centers until they were sent to appear before an immigration court or deported.","Of late, though, the government hascracked downon parents and children attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without legal permission. In April 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessionsannouncedthat Homeland Security would refer all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Parents faced with criminal charges would go to detention centers, leaving their newly unaccompanied children to be managed by the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services.","On \"Think,\" a public-affairs program produced at Dallas-based KERA radio, Cruz said:","\"You know, you think about it, when someone gets arrested for a crime -- let\u2019s say an American citizen gets arrested for a crime, for murder, for burglary, for whatever \u2014 if you\u2019re arrested for a crime, you\u2019re separated from your children, you\u2019re put in prison. If you\u2019re the only caregiver for that child, then you\u2019ve got to find alternative care for those children. That is often another family member or, if need be, it\u2019s a foster family or some other means to care for kids. That is the inevitable consequence of somebody being arrested for a crime.","\"This is an issue that, I think, the media has largely constructed because what\u2019s shifted is that the (President Donald) Trump administration is endeavoring if people cross illegally to arrest them, not to let them go--and so if they have kids, you know, there is actually a court order that prevents keeping the kids with the parents when you put the parents in jail.\"","A 1997 agreement","We sought detail about the described order; Maria Jeffrey in Cruz\u2019s Senate office told us by email that Cruz was referring to a 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department.","We didn\u2019t spot language in the January 1997agreement in Flores v. Renothat explicitly bars children from staying with parents who have been detained or jailed. (See our summary of the agreement here.)","There\u2019s no such provision in the agreement, immigration lawyers told us.","\"Absolutely not,\"Denise Gilman, who heads an immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said by email, a conclusion also aired byPeter Scheyof the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights, which was involved in the litigation that led to the agreement.","Muzaffar Chishti, a New York lawyer for the Migration Policy Institute, called Cruz\u2019s claim an \"inverse interpretation\" of the Flores agreement. \"He\u2019s basically saying a court order that mandates protecting children is the one that says you must separate families,\" Chishti said by phone. Put another way,Rick Suof the University of Buffalo School of Law said by email that the Flores agreement can be read as barring children from jail, but Su said it doesn\u2019t condone or require the separation of children from parents.","\u2018Least restrictive setting\u2019","We read the agreement, which says it sets out national policy for the detention, release and treatment of minors in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which was the government agency overseeing immigration matters before Congress after 9\/11 reorganized and renamed departments under the new Department of Homeland Security.","\"The INS,\" the agreement states, \"shall place each detained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor\u2019s age and special needs\" provided the minor is poised to make timely appearances before immigration authorities and her or his well-being is protected.","We noticed, too, that the agreement stresses keeping children close to parents and extended family.","For instance, it says INS facilities will provide \"contact with family members who were arrested with the minor\" and segregate unaccompanied minors from unrelated adults.","Also, the agreement says, where the INS finds the detention of a minor isn\u2019t required to secure his or her timely appearance, it shall release the minor \"without unnecessary delay.\" The minor, the agreement says, should be released, in order of preference, to a parent, a legal guardian, an adult relative or an adult individual or entity designated by the parent or legal guardian or parent. Subsequent choices, the agreement says, extend to licensed programs or, ultimately, another adult or entity seeking custody as an alternative to long-term custody and when \"family reunification does not appear to be a reasonable possibility.\"","Instructions to INS \"service officers\" in the agreement include a section titled \"family reunification,\" which says: \"Upon taking a minor into custody, the INS, or the licensed program in which the minor is placed, will promptly attempt to reunite the minor with his or her family to permit the release of the minor\" in accord with the agreement\u2019s order-of-preference list. \"Such efforts at family reunification,\" the instructions say, \"will continue so long as the minor is in INS or licensed program custody.\"","Additional interpretation","We asked Cruz\u2019s aide to point out the part of the agreement requiring the separation of children from parents. By email, Jeffrey noted the mandate that minors be placed in the \"least restrictive\" setting and the section about minors being released to family members if possible.","Jeffrey further pointed out that the California-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016heldthat the Flores agreement applies to all minors, not just those traveling unaccompanied. In that dispute, over the Obama administration placing children with their parents in family detention centers, the appeals court upheld a lower court\u2019s refusal to amend the Flores agreement to accommodate family detention--after which, Su told us, the Obama administration chose to simply release such parents and children.","Jeffrey wrote that Cruz\u2019s \"point is simple and 100% correct: When the parents are detained, the Flores agreement compels placing the child with another family member or in another less restrictive setting.\"","Su alerted us to another arguably influential factor; a 2008 law requires immigration officials holding a minor to transfer the minor to the care of HHS within 72 hours \"after determining that such child is an unaccompanied alien child,\" theWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008states.","Government has options","Gilman said Cruz\u2019s claim misleads in part by suggesting parents are getting shuttled into criminal jails and then children, newly unaccompanied, quickly must be handed off to the refugee resettlement office.","What actually happens, Gilman wrote, is that parents and children are detained in a border facility and children are taken from parents while the family is at the facility, before criminal charges are brought. Next, Gilman wrote, children are taken into custody and away from the facility by refugee resettlement staff. Only then, Gilman said, are the parents criminally prosecuted before being given a sentence of time served, \"which really is just the time spent at the border facility,\" Gilman said.","Next, Gilman said, parents are returned to the border facility \"but the child is already gone.\" At that point, the parents are typically sent to an adult immigration detention facility to spend several months--even if they\u2019re successful in passing an asylum screening interview and getting released on bond, Gilman wrote.","Su called Cruz\u2019s claim technically correct but misleading in that it leaves the inaccurate impression that the government, by policy and law, has no choice but to separate children from parents.","\"The Trump administration\u2019s hands were not forced,\" Su wrote. \"There are multiple ways that separation could be avoided and the nation's interest in immigration adjudication and removal could still be maintained. But the \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy of detaining and criminally prosecuting all immigrants, even those who arrived with children, is what has led to this.\"","Summing up, Su said the 2008 law, Flores agreement and court rulings effectively bar the government from sending a detained parent and child to an adult prison together. By policy, Su said, the Trump administration made clear it wasn\u2019t in favor of releasing parents and children--which left it with the options of sending parents to prison and releasing children or sending parents to prison and sending children to child detention facilities overseen by the government.","Su said Cruz\u2019s claim, intimating the government has had no choice but to separate children from parents, also overlooks the government\u2019s power to release children to other family members or guardians or even to expand family detention centers so long as they fulfill the agreement\u2019s \"least restrictive setting\" requirement.","\"So yes,\" Su said, \"Cruz is right that once you have make the decision to send the parents to jail, separation may be necessary because Flores generally forbids the government from detaining children in jail,\" Su wrote.","\"Although given the horrors of separation, and the rumors of children not being reunited with their parents even after removal,\" Su said, \"it may be that keeping parents and children together in jail would be the \u2018least restrictive setting\u2019 if the other option is separation. It is important to note that, from my reading, neither the Flores settlement nor the litigants and judge involved foresaw that the settlement would lead to separation of parents of children,\" Su said.","Our ruling"]}
