However, many other types of firearms, such as bolt-action rifles and shotguns, remained in private ownership.\n\nQuestion: Are stricter gun laws associated with a reduction in violent crime?\nLabel: Nei\nConfidence: Medium\nJustification: The effectiveness of stricter gun laws in reducing violent crime is disputed and may vary depending on the specific context of the region implementing the laws. Some examples, like Australia, suggest that stricter gun laws can lead to a reduction in firearm-related deaths. However, other factors, such as cultural attitudes, enforcement capabilities, and the availability of firearms in neighboring regions, can also influence violent crime rates. Therefore, attributing a reduction in violent crime solely to stricter gun laws may not be accurate.\n\nQuestion: Do gun buyback programs lead to a significant decrease in the number of firearms in circulation?\nLabel: Yes\nConfidence: Medium\nJustification: Gun buyback programs can lead to a significant decrease in the number of firearms in circulation, as demonstrated by Australia's example in 1996.
