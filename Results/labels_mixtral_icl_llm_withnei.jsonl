Some government-backed loan programs, such as VA loans (for military veterans) and USDA loans (for rural areas), allow for zero-down payment options. Additionally, some lenders may offer alternative financing options, such as piggyback mortgages, that effectively allow for no down payment. However, these options may come with additional requirements or costs.\n\nQuestion: Is a ketogenic (keto) diet a proven solution for treating epilepsy?\nDate: 19 May, 2016\nLabel: Yes\nConfidence: High\nJustification: A ketogenic diet has been proven to be an effective treatment option for epilepsy, particularly for children with refractory epilepsy (epilepsy that does not respond to medication). The diet involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat intake, putting the body into a state of ketosis, which can help reduce seizure activity in some individuals. The diet should be medically supervised, and its long-term effects on health are still being investigated.\n\nQuestion: Can a person live solely on the interest earned from a 5-million-dollar investment?\nDate: 11 August, 2017\nLabel: Yes\nConfidence: High\nJustification: Depending on the interest rate and investment vehicle, a person could potentially live solely on the interest earned from a $5 million investment. For example, if the investment generates a 4% annual return, the individual would earn $200,000 in interest each year. However, this amount would need to cover all living expenses, taxes, and other costs, which could be substantial depending on the individual's lifestyle. It is essential to consider inflation and the potential for market fluctuations when planning to live off investment income.\n\nQuestion: Does the Catholic Church allow married priests?\nDate: 15 March, 2017\nLabel: Nei\nConfidence: Medium\nJustification: The Catholic Church does allow married priests in certain circumstances, but it is not a common practice. For instance, Protestant clergy who convert to Catholicism and were previously married may be allowed to serve as priests. However, the Catholic Church maintains that celibacy is the preferred state for priests in the Latin (Western) Rite, and the practice of allowing married priests is generally not extended to priests ordained within the Latin Rite.

The most notable example is the Great Depression, which began in 1929 and lasted until 1941, a period of over ten years. This extended period of economic downturn included a significant decline in industrial production, high levels of unemployment, and widespread poverty.\n\nQuestion: 7. Is it true that the United States has more people in prison than any other country?\nDate: 15 January, 2015\nLabel: Yes\nConfidence: High\nJustification: The United States does have more people in prison than any other country, both in terms of the total number of prisoners and the incarceration rate. This trend has been attributed to a variety of factors, including strict sentencing laws, a focus on punishment rather than rehabilitation, and a high level of crime in some areas.\n\nQuestion: 8. Did the United States government declare war on Japan on December 7, 1941?\nDate: 24 November, 2014\nLabel: No\nConfidence: High\nJustification: The United States government did not declare war on Japan on December 7, 1941. Instead, Japan declared war on the United States on December 8, 1941, in response to the U.S. embargo on oil exports to Japan. The United States responded by declaring war on Japan on December 8, 1941, as well. The misconception may arise from the fact that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, was the primary catalyst for the U.S. entering World War II.\n\nQuestion: 9. Is it true that the Great Wall of China is visible from space?\nDate: 10 December, 2013\nLabel: No\nConfidence: High\nJustification: Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall of China is not visible from space with the naked eye. This misconception has been debunked by astronauts, who have stated that they were unable to see the wall from space. Even with the aid of telescopic lenses, the wall is difficult to distinguish from the surrounding landscape due to its narrow width and similar color to the surrounding terrain.\n\nQuestion: 10. Did the FDA approve the use of the drug thalidomide in the United States in the 1950s?\nDate: 15 August, 2016\nLabel: No\nConfidence: High\nJustification: The FDA did not approve the use of the drug thalidomide in the United States in the 1950s. Despite being approved in several other countries, the drug was never officially approved for use in the U.S. due to concerns about its safety. Thalidomide was later found to be responsible for causing severe birth defects when taken by pregnant women.

While the wall is indeed a remarkable engineering achievement, it is not wide or long enough to be visible from low Earth orbit without the aid of telescopic lenses. Other man-made structures, such as large cities and airports, are more easily visible from space.\n\nQuestion: Is it true that cats always land on their feet?\nDate: 12 November, 2012\nLabel: Yes\nConfidence: High\nJustification: Cats have a remarkable ability to right themselves in mid-air and land on their feet, even when falling from significant heights. This is due to their flexible bodies and a reflex known as the \"righting reflex,\" which allows them to rotate their bodies and adjust their posture in order to land on their feet. However, it is worth noting that this instinct does not make them immune to injury, particularly if they fall from very high distances or land on a hard or uneven surface.\n\nQuestion: Is the cost of college tuition increasing?\nDate: 12 September, 2018\nLabel: Yes\nConfidence: High\nJustification: The cost of college tuition has been increasing steadily for many years, outpacing inflation and making it more difficult for many students and families to afford higher education. This trend has been driven by a variety of factors, including cuts in state funding for public universities, increased demand for degrees, and rising administrative costs. While there have been some efforts to address this issue, such as the development of low-cost online degree programs and the expansion of financial aid, the overall trend has been one of steady increases in tuition costs.\n\nQuestion: Is it true that the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world?\nDate: 10 February, 2014\nLabel: Yes\nConfidence: High\nJustification: The United States does indeed have the highest incarceration rate in the world, with over 2.2 million people currently behind bars. This represents a significant increase over the past few decades, and is due in part to tough-on-crime policies and mandatory minimum sentencing laws.

This was due to the introduction of personal computers, digital document management systems, and other technologies that were expected to make paper-based processes obsolete.
