Trump 's recent comments , calling some immigrants from Mexico as drug traffickers and rapists , have stirred up reactions on both sides of the aisle . Although fellow Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry has denounced Trump 's comments and his campaign in general , U.S . Senator from Texas Ted-Cruz has so far refused to bash his fellow Republican nominee .

Trump has always touted himself as a great deal-maker and outlines the genesis of his penchant for risky investments in his first book , \u201c The Art of the Deal , \u201d which chronicles the early deals that helped establish him as a major player in New York \u2019 s real-estate market.But those comments are just one of many that could come back to haunt him as he heads into a general election showdown with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . Clinton and Democratic Party operatives have telegraphed plans to paint Trump as a greedy con-man whose business acumen is overblown and whose policies most benefit himself , and comments he \u2019 s made touting profits from the pain of millions of Americans who lost their homes in the housing market crash will help them make their case.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on his past statements.His remarks to the Globe and Mail weren \u2019 t the only he made on the money-making possibilities found in a bursting bubble.The real-estate mogul lost big during the early 1990s recession , filing bankruptcies on a number of properties and liquidating others to keep himself above-water . But in 2004 , Trump told CNN , \u201c I love bad markets , \u201d insisting the real-estate market crash in the late 1980s wasn \u2019 t the main driver of his financial difficulties. \u201c The real estate markets crashed . Now , I do n't want to blame the real estate markets , because I always made a lot of money in bad markets . I love bad markets . You can do very well in a bad market , \u201d he said.And that was the exact advice he gave followers of Trump University a year later , framing the next housing bubble \u2014 at that time , still just a theoretical risk posed by analysts \u2014 as a \u201c remarkable opportunity. \u201d \u201c How you react to the so-called housing bubble can be a barometer of your business personality . Are you the type of person who takes advantage of positive situations when they present themselves\u2026or do you heed every message of doom and gloom , avoiding risks that could be some remarkable opportunities ? \u201d he wrote in a 2005 post on his Trump University blog.A CNN report last week unearthed his 2006 declaration in a Trump University audiobook that \u201c I sort of hope \u201d the real estate market crashes.In his 2006 audio book \u201c Bubble-Proof Real Estate Investing , \u201d Trump also framed the housing bubble as an opportunity for profit for those \u201c willing to do what it takes . `` \u201c Is it the so-called bubble you 're afraid of or is it hard work ? If you 're willing to do what it takes , you will succeed in any market , \u201d he said.The audiobook directed those interested in learning \u201c what it takes \u201d to subscribe to the full 12-month program at TrumpUniversity.com.Alexandra JaffeAboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of Service ( Updated JULY 7 , 2023 ) NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance\u00a9 2023 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo", "score": 33.052895529692805}, {"url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-2007-i-m-excited-housing-market-crash-n578761", "snippet": "May 23, 2016 ...

Published Sat , May 28 201612:50 AM EDTUpdated Sat , May 28 20169:06 AM EDTLawrence Kudlow and Stephen Moore , chief economist at the Heritage Foundation WATCH LIVEWe are going to reveal the grand secret to getting rich by investing . It 's a simple formula that has worked for Warren Buffett , Carl Icahn and all the greatest investment gurus over the years . Ready ? Buy low , sell high.It turns out that Donald Trump has been very , very good at buying low and selling high , and it helps account for his amazin business success.But now Hillary Clinton seems to think it 's a crime . Real culprits ? A bank owned sign is seen in front of a foreclosed home.Getty Images Campaigning in California last week she complained that Trump `` actually said he was hoping for the crash that caused hard working families in California and across America to lose their homes , all because he thought he could take advantage of it to make some money for himself . '' She 's assailing Trump for being a good businessman\u2014something she would know almost nothing about because she 's never actually run a business , though she did miraculously turn $ 1,000 into $ 1 million in the cattle futures market many years ago . Hillary 's new TV ads say that Trump predicted the real estate crash in 2006 ( good call ) and then bought real estate at low prices when the housing crash came in 2008 that few others foresaw . Many builders went out of business during the crash , but Trump read the market perfectly . What is so hypocritical about the Clinton attacks is that it was n't Trump , but Hillary , her husband , and many of her biggest supporters who were the real culprits here . Before Hillary is able to rewrite this history , let 's look at the many ways the Clintons and cronies contributed to the Great Recession.Seeds of mortgage meltdownWhy did foreclosures spike in October ? Repossessions spike 66 % as foreclosure crisis lingers The seeds of the mortgage meltdown were planted during Bill Clinton 's presidency.Under Clinton 's Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) secretary , Andrew Cuomo , Community Reinvestment Act regulators gave banks higher ratings for home loans made in `` credit-deprived '' areas . Banks were effectively rewarded for throwing out sound underwriting standards and writing loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting . If banks did n't comply with these rules , regulators reined in their ability to expand lending and deposits . These new HUD rules lowered down payments from the traditional 20 percent to 3 percent by 1995 and zero down-payments by 2000 . What 's more , in the Clinton push to issue home loans to lower income borrowers , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made a common practice to virtually end credit documentation , low credit scores were disregarded , and income and job history was also thrown aside . The phrase `` subprime '' became commonplace . What an understatement . Next , the Clinton administration 's rules ordered the taxpayer-backed Fannie and Freddie to expand their quotas of risky loans from 30 percent of portfolio to 50 percent as part of a big push to expand home ownership . Fannie and Freddie were securitizing these home loans and offering 100 percent taxpayer guarantees of repayment . So now taxpayers were on the hook for these risky , low down-payment loans . Tragically , when prices fell , lower-income folks who really could not afford these mortgages under normal credit standards , suffered massive foreclosures and personal bankruptcies . So many will never get credit again . It 's a perfect example of liberals using government allegedly to help the poor , but the ultimate consequences were disastrous for them . Additionally , ultra-easy money from the Fed also played a key role . Rates were held too low for too long in 2002-2005 , which created asset price bubbles in housing , commodities , gold , oil , and elsewhere . When the Fed finally tightened , prices collapsed . So did mortgage collateral ( homes ) and mortgage bonds that depended on the collateral . Many bond packages were written to please Fannie and Freddie , based on the fantastical idea that home prices would never fall . Fannie and Freddie , by the way , cost the taxpayers $ 187 billion . Just to make this story worse , Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama voted to filibuster a Republican effort to roll back Fannie and Freddie . But on top of all this , while Hillary was propping up Fannie and Freddie , she was taking contributions from their foundations . Plenty of blame to go around A Washington Times investigative report concluded that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae 's political action committee and individuals linked to the companies donated $ 75,500 to Mrs. Clinton 's senatorial campaign . And on top of that , the embattled Clinton Foundation received a $ 50,000 contribution from Freddie Mac , according to the Times . To be clear , there was plenty of blame to go around among both political parties and the horde of housing lobbyists who helped set up this real estate house of cards . It 's a sordid story with plenty of blame all around . And the Fannie/Freddie story is still not solved . It now includes profit sweeping from shareholders to the government , thereby ending any chance to sell the mortgage agencies back to the private sector . Meanwhile , Hillary 's attempt to blame Donald Trump is utterly absurd . Buying low and selling high is not against the law . In fact , Mr. Trump 's investment acumen may serve America well in the not too distant future.Commentary by Larry Kudlow , a senior contributor at CNBC and economics editor of the National Review .

( Photo by Robin Holland ) This week on the JOURNAL , Bill Moyers spoke with scholars Eric Foner and Patricia Williams about Tuesday 's historic election and what it means for America 's future . Foner suggested that Barack Obama could pursue a progressive presidency : `` There really is a chance for a new paradigm now , and I think if he moves forward and puts forward a new governing principle for the country , it will be progressive . It 's not that we just have to go back and reenact the New Deal or reenact TR 's policies , but something which breaks really dramatically from the Reagan ideology ... I do n't want to say he has the specific policy . But I think it 's more of an ethos of public life , a more communal one that looks after the common good and not just individual self-interest as we 've been ruled by for the last 20 , 30 years , that does n't seek competitiveness as the sole measure of a society . '' In an editorial , the WASHINGTON EXAMINER argued that Obama and the Democrats carry `` a mandate for conciliation , not for ideology '' : `` The reason it 's not an ideological mandate of the sort given to the conservative Ronald Reagan in 1980 is because , unlike Reagan ( who also won a much bigger victory ) , the liberal Barack Obama did as much to shade his ideology as to proclaim it ... He consistently emphasized proposals more often associated with conservatives than liberals : tax cuts , greater numbers of military personnel , and a `` net spending cut '' for the federal government ( even if his spending numbers never came close to adding up ) ... this victory certainly was not ' a progressive mandate . ' '' What do you think ? Did America give Obama a progressive mandate ? Tag ( s ) : America Posted by Bill Moyers Journal on November 7 , 2008 4:02 PM | Permalink TrackBack TrackBack URL for this entry : http : //www.pbs.org/moyers/mt4/mt-tb.cgi/1722 Comments By JB Williams Saturday , April 24 , 2010 Members from all three branches of the Federal government already know that Barack Hussein Obama is ineligible for the office of President . National leaders , to include members of the US Supreme Court , already know that Barack Hussein Obama is not a \u201c natural born citizen \u201d of the United States of America , and therefore , is ineligible for the office he currently holds . ( See JB \u2019 s new article on The Bottom Line on Natural Born Citizen ) What they don \u2019 t know is how long it will take for most Americans to figure it out , or what to do about it . The diversionary search for an authentic birth certificate is ongoing and Obama has now spent in excess of $ 2 million in legal fees to keep that search alive . Eric Holder \u2019 s Department of Justice continues to deploy taxpayer funded attorneys around the country to file dismissals on behalf of Obama , denying all American citizens access to the courts as a peaceful remedy , which only fuels the fire of discontent and the questions about Obama persist . Posted by : Joe A. Everson | April 27 , 2010 10:52 AM Um ... who won the election ? Why are we getting the same old faces for key positions - Clintons picks - instead of something new ? I begin to feel vaguely uneasy ... Posted by : Sherry | November 21 , 2008 2:57 AM It is important to remember just how non-specific and intentionally vague Obama was during the campaign , especilly befor the Financial Crisis became visible . He was about 40 % of Howard Dean and less than one percent of RFK and MLK , when it comes to raising fundemental questions about the structure of the US permanent war economy . THIS IS A REALITY THAT MUST BE CONFRONTED WHEN WE ASK `` WHAT MANDATE DOES OBAMA HAVE ? The fact is that a funemental critique of the status quo , will simply not be allowed to reach November 's national micraphone , no matter how popular it may prove to be . That is the job of Corporate Insider lobbyists like William Schneieder of CNN who is a creature of the Oil and Bank funded AEI think tank , the very think tank that RFK was investigating re : the legality of its tax exemt status at the time of the coup d'etat of 11/22/63 . ( See interesting Washington Post article of 1963 by Post reporter Larry Stern on this AEI investigation ) . Now whatever mandate there was is being further blunted by Obamas apointments and chirping of the need for more bipartisanship . The reality is just the opposite . There is all too little difference between our two political parties . The Democrats put mummies in the speaker positions of both houses , and did not say one single thing in strong opposition to the most extremist policies in American History . Rahm Emanuel , pro-war Likkud Democrat is the mandate of oil-bank- and weapons R ' U.S. aka Wall Street , the real electorate . By the way please read the Daniel Ellsberg and Marcus Raskin endoresed masterpiece JFK and the Unspeakable , Why He Died and Why It Matters . This book shows JFK in the elbow of the COld War , the last time flexibility could be imagined , fleetingly . Posted by : Nathaniel Heidenheimer | November 20 , 2008 10:53 AM `` I have been hearing lately US media questioning if Mr. Obama should govern from the center , I believe this would be a great disservice to the United States ; I believe Mr. Obama should embrace his international mandate of real change with an American bias of course even if some of these changes are moderately painful , this is the only way to re-integrate the US whole heartedly back into the international community and more importantly teach the world much more effectively than the previous administration the valuable virtues of democracy . '' I fully vouchsafe the above quote from one of the respondents . We direly need a radical CHANGE and we HOPE that the change comes . American media-persons are misinterpreting the mandate . One simple example . Getting a pet dog to enter in the White House as president should not be the topic . Here is one quote Obama \u2019 s daughters now will get In Washington a brand new pet . The White House halls will echo \u2014 heark ! With sounds of both Barack and bark . Tradition calls for presidents To have cute pups as residents . They help relieve the strain and stress Of known executive distress . Republicans and Democrats Who often clash like dogs and cats On this one point alike agree : The presidential family Deserves to have a canine pal , A tender , loving animal . On White House gate post an affiche : \u201c We \u2019 ve signed a brand-new four-year leash. \u201d Where better might a canine dwell ? ( We query here in doggerel ) . How nice that girls , while growing up , Should share the White House with a pup ! ( Not hamster , guinea pig , or guppy ! Just a lively , playful puppy ! ) Neuter , masculine , or bitch ? We \u2019 ll soon be told just which-is-which . Hirsute or bald or full of fur ? A mongrel , thoroughbred , or cur ? When journalists the news pursue ( We mean the press , the White House crew ) , Attempting to attain a scoop , They \u2019 ll surely find the latest poop ! http : //www.forward.com/articles/14535/ Posted by : Ramafuchs | November 18 , 2008 4:07 PM I do n't think Obama 's and America 's victory this November was a mandate for Progressivism it was amandate for Pragmatic Politics which seeks to achieve the best results for the country . It so happens the ways to do this have been part of the so called `` Liberal '' or `` Progressive '' agenda for many years .

Vince Posted by : Vince Wilyard | November 8 , 2008 12:13 PM If `` progressive '' means carrying out the law rather than subverting it , basing decisions on science rather than industry propaganda , informing citizens about government activities rather than lying about or covering them up , and spending taxpayer money wisely rather than giving it away in an orgy of crony capitalism , then Obama got a progressive mandate . Some would expect conservatives to demand the same thing . Posted by : Still Cynical | November 8 , 2008 11:52 AM Did America give Obama a progressive mandate ? Yes President Obama has a clear mandate for policies that appear to be good ideas . These include progressive policies that work or appear to have good chance of working . This is also true of conservative and centrist policies . But it seems safe to say that the results of this election show that America will give progressive policies a chance , when they appear to be well thought out and clearly articulated . Posted by : framingtheissues | November 8 , 2008 9:50 AM I voted for President-Elect Obama . I have great confidence in him . I would have liked to have voted for Senator Clinton for president , but Senator Obama is fine . I would not have been greatly upset had Senator McCain won , but I think that Senator Obama had the edge . We were blessed this year . I wish our newly elected president well . He makes a fine impression . Posted by : Ted Michael Morgan | November 8 , 2008 9:05 AM Obama is the president- elect . I voted for Barack Obama . This is a momentous , historic , powerfully symbolic , unprecedented election result . I refused to contribute one penny to either campaign , instead holding out for campaign reform , which will not come anytime soon . Now let me submit some qualifiers : In US-style advanced capitalism , most recently in its corporate bailout phase , all discourses , ( from slavery onwards ) , are commodified . The Obama Brand prevailed ( for now ) against the McCain Brand , in a Coke vs. Pepsi contest . This does not imply that there are no differences between Barack Obama and John McCain . But , No matter who is elected , institutional multinational corporatism will trump democracy and civil society . Barack Obama was elected because he can best satisfy the American electorate 's need to continue to engage in commodified discourse . The US public wants to consume without producing ; wants a `` tough '' President and Congress and Supreme Court ( which means the US can not be a co-equal player in the world community of nations but instead will continue to try to dominate the globalized economy even though it has a failed economy ; violate human rights in Iraq and elsewhere which it invaded and continues to occupy ; consume energy resources in a wasteful and harmful manner . Barack Obama is a neoliberal rather than a radical progressive . He is no FDR . He is no Carter . He is a Clintocrat . I voted for him because he ( possibly ) is likely to do less harm than McCain , in the US and the world . Chithra Karunakaran http : //www.EthicalDemocracy.blogspot.com Posted by : Chithra KarunaKaran | November 8 , 2008 7:55 AM There is no mandate . Obama 's victory was hardly a landslide . And can we really be certain it was indeed a victory ? Have all the voting problems of 2000 been corrected ? How can Obama be called progressive ? He wants a larger military . More wars . More security forces . He does not support impeachment of Bush/Cheney . He has not supported the 9/11 Truth movement . He has not tried to end the Iraq war . He supported the new FISA legislation . He voted for the so called bailout . Has he exposed the war on drugs as a fraud ? The judicial and prison system as a fraud ? He is nothing but a corporate shill . He is a marketing campaign . He is a fraud , and millions have been fooled . How can anyone not see that Obama was picked by the elite to be the President ? Do you think that if he actually really cared about people , and tried to do something , he would get anywhere near the presidency ? Why do you think truly honorable and courageous people like Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney are mocked and ignored ? Because they are real . They pose a threat to the elites and corporations . Obama is a friend and ally of the corporations . He is owned by the corporations . Without the corporations there is no Obama . Posted by : beecham | November 8 , 2008 3:57 AM The mandate is for change . What the mandate amounts to is end the fiasco in Iraq , change the economics from supply side to demand side with trickle up instead of trickle down economics , provide universal health care and reinstate our liberties and privacy . We also need to define terms in such a way as they say what they mean and mean what they say . There are many words that are inconsistent with intent and/or meaningless . `` Progressive '' can mean just about anything depending on what is doing the progressing . `` Conservative '' can be fiscal , religious or just plain stingy . If we are going to solve the present disaster ; it will be necessary to forget conservative and do what ever it takes to solve the problem . `` Band aid '' solutions will only prolong the agony . We need to fine tune our social and economic systems so that they provide everyone a quality life experience . When we accomplish that agenda ; we will have a nation worth emulating . Posted by : David Eddy | November 8 , 2008 3:25 AM Dear selehka , Both Obama and McCain voted to bail out the rich with your money going up to the rich on Wall Street . How is that change ? Also , I did n't mention color , you did . Posted by : Joe A. Everson | November 8 , 2008 3:17 AM Thank you Bill Moyers , for an outstanding opening essay for tonight 's show . I have always wondered why McCain went on and on about his five years as a prisoner of war and how he suffered for his country when hundreds of thousands of Blacks and people of color have suffered lifetimes for their country ... in their country ! I belive the suffering of the Blacks , Native Americans , and minority immigrants is a thousand fold more meaningful than McCain `` service to his country '' . It is minority America and the pain they have endured which deserves the highest rank of service to America . They are what makes America great .

I was born in Hawaii. \u201d Obama was looking forward to spending the night at his house in Kenwood , on the city \u2019 s South Side\u2014the redbrick Georgian Revival pile that he and Michelle and their daughters left behind when they took up residence in the White House . He arrived fairly late , after 10:00 p.m. , but then stayed up even later , intrigued by some old boxes that had belonged to his late mother , Ann Dunham.Dunham had died seven years earlier , but Obama hadn \u2019 t sorted through all her things . Now , alone in his old house for just the third night since he \u2019 d become president , he started rummaging through the boxes , digging , digging , until suddenly he found it : a small , four-paneled paper booklet the world had never seen before . On the front was an ink drawing of Kapi \u2018 olani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital , in Honolulu . On the back was a picture of a Hawaiian queen . On one inside page were his name , his mother \u2019 s name , and his date of birth ; on the other were his infant footprints.The next morning , Marty Nesbitt came over to have breakfast with Obama . The CEO of an airport parking-lot company , Nesbitt was part of a tiny circle of Chicago friends on whom the president relied to keep him anchored in a reality outside the Washington funhouse . The two men had bonded playing pickup basketball two decades earlier ; their relationship was still firmly rooted in sports , talking smack , and all around regular-guyness . After chatting for a while at the kitchen table , Obama went upstairs and came back down , wearing a cat-who-ate-a-whole-flock-of-canaries grin , waving the booklet in the air , and then placing it in front of Nesbitt. \u201c Now , that \u2019 s some funny shit , \u201d Nesbitt said , and burst out laughing.Clambering into his heavily armored SUV , Obama headed back north to the InterContinental hotel , where he had an interview scheduled with the Associated Press . He pulled aside his senior adviser David Plouffe and press secretary Jay Carney , and eagerly showed them his discovery.Plouffe studied the thing , befuddled and wary : Is that the birth certificate ? he thought.Carney was bewildered , too , but excited : This is the birth certificate ? Awesome.Obama didn \u2019 t know what to think , but he flew back to Washington hoping that maybe , just maybe , he now had a stake to drive through the heart of birtherism , killing it once and for all\u2014and slaying Trump in the bargain . Striding into a meeting with his senior advisers in the Oval Office the next Monday morning , he reached into his suit pocket and whipped out the booklet , infinitely pleased with himself. \u201c Hey , \u201d Obama announced , \u201c look what I found when I was out there ! \u201d Excerpted from the book DOUBLE DOWN : Game Change 2012 , by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann .

OLBERMANN : Yes.MADDOW : I \u2018 ve been upgraded . OLBERMANN : Well , I was referring to this hour and now you \u2018 re another hour , I wasn \u2018 t\u2014go ahead , please.MADDOW : Thank you very much , Keith . Appreciate it . ( LAUGHTER ) MADDOW : And thanks to you for staying with us for the next hour of excitement and fun.The U.K. election , the latest on the Times Square bombing , and the coverage of the Times Square bombing , plus , the dramatic new news on the B.P . oil disaster in the Gulf today\u2014that is all still to come this hour.But we start with this : How much would you pay for a Sam Adams right now ? An ice cold Samuel Adams Boston Lager ? How about if I told you you could have one for free ? Actually , scratch that . How about if I told you you could have the entire company for free ? For a very , very brief un-shining moment this afternoon , Wall Street valued the entire Boston Beer Company , the company that makes Sam Adams beer , Wall Street valued the entire company at precisely zero dollars.Boston Beer was a number of companies who , in the bizarre flash crash that happened on Wall Street today , briefly saw its stock price go to zero . The company was worth zero dollars.It wasn \u2018 t the only one . A blog at \u201c The Wall Street Journal \u201d today rounded up some of the others . Exelon , one of the largest utility companies in the world , normally valued at about $ 30 billion , today was briefly worth zero dollars . It was free . The stock price of Exelon was zero.Same goes for Accenture , the big consulting firm . Stock price at one point today , zero.The utility CenterPoint Energy , also , stock price : zero . The specialty pharmaceutical company Impact Labs , again , stock price at one point today , zero.Even if you don \u2018 t know anything about the stock market , you can see from the stock prices and the graphs that we just put up that aside from the huge flash drop in the middle of the afternoon , the prices of shares of those companies was actually relatively steady today . They all went down a little bit from opening bell to closing bell , but nothing that would get them on to cable news show that \u2018 s aren \u2018 t usually about the stock market.Do you want to know even something weirder that happened today ? Even weirder than all of those stocks going to zero at one point ? It wasn \u2018 t just stocks dropping inexplicably to zero. \u201c The Journal \u201d also notes that at the same time that some companies were becoming free , becoming valued at absolutely nothing according to Wall Street , some other companies went off charts in the other direction . The auction house , Sotheby \u2018 s , for example , which has the stock price bid , get it , Sotheby \u2018 s auction\u2014Sotheby \u2018 s started the day with its shares costing $ 34 and something.Sotheby \u2018 s ended the day with its stock costing $ 33 . It \u2018 s a drop , but it \u2018 s no big , right ? It goes between $ 34 and $ 33 , whatever . Until you notice that in the middle of the day , at one point , the stock price of Sotheby \u2018 s shares went to $ 100,000 per share\u2014which means that at some point today , Sotheby \u2018 s went from a company being worth $ 2.2 billion to being a company worth $ 6.8 trillion . Which means , for a minute , that one company had a net worth of somewhere between the size of the entire economies of the United States and China.Congratulations , Sotheby \u2018 s . Bid high.Even for people who don \u2018 t watch the stock market , what happened on the market today was nuts . It was crazy . And then almost as soon as it happened , the flash crash was over.I want you to watch this one insane minute of what happened on CNBC during this weird crash . It was\u2014again , this is a very specific moment in which this all happened this afternoon , just watch this\u2014watch what happened on CNBC . We always have this on in the background of the offices here , right ? And on CNBC during this minute , they \u2018 re talking about Procter & Gamble stocks.Watch this . ( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : P & G is now down 25 percent.UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Well , if that \u2018 s true , if that stock is there , you just go and buy it . It can \u2018 t be there . That is not a real price . ( CROSSTALK ) UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Oh , just go buy Procter ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : This is unprecedented.UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Just go buy Procter & Gamble . Just go buy it.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : It is liquidating . There \u2018 s a distress . ( CROSSTALK ) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Something else happened here.UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Forty-nine a quarter bid for 50,000 Procter in my hedge fund . I mean , this is good\u2014 ( CROSSTALK ) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : -- that \u2018 s incredible . Nothing has changed for Procter & Gamble in the past four minutes . Nothing.UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Well , when I looked at it , it was $ 61 I \u2018 m not interested . It \u2018 s at $ 47 , well , that \u2018 s a different security entirely . So , what you have to do , though , you have to use limited orders because Procter just jumped seven points because I said I liked it at $ 49 . So , I mean , you got to be careful.When Rick Santelli was saying , look , you know , this is a dangerous market . What I \u2018 m saying you put in a $ 49 bid for 200 shares for Procter , if you get hit , fine.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Right.UNIDENTIFIED MALE : This is very much 1987 , a little different from 2007 . So in 1987 , there was a breakdown where Procter goes from , say , $ 50 to $ 12 . All right ? And you want to be there at $ 13 . I mean\u2014 ( CROSSTALK ) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : Wait , wait , look . It \u2018 s coming up.UNIDENTIFIED MALE : It \u2018 s a fast market . It \u2018 s a fast market.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : But the market was down 900 points , we \u2018 re now down 688.UNIDENTIFIED MALE : So , I buy 50,000 at $ 49 . And now , flip it at $ 59 , and I just made\u2014I just made 500 Gs . ( END VIDEO CLIP ) MADDOW : I just made 500 Gs . Anybody who just did what I said to do just made hundreds of thousands of dollars , millions of dollars ? Boom ! And then it was over.The stocks go , boink and then come back up . The markets overall still ended up over 300 points down today . But at one point , they were down more than 1,000 points.NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange , ultimately , late in the day , decided to do something kind of amazing . They decided to cancel , to annul all the trades that took place in that crazy moment . They decided to annul all of the trades between 2:40 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern , if those trades showed a fluctuation of more than", "score": 21.918830305574883}, {"url": "http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/blog/2008/02/election_ads_narratives_and_so_1.html", "snippet": "Feb 29, 2008 ...

It was related at first to text . I am competent to say after all my years examining post modern philosophy that what Bill and Kathleen think of as deconstruction is pop culture garbage . If anyone has a pointed disregard for all three leading candidates ( and Mr. Nader , Rev . Huckabee and Ron Paul etc . ) , I do . The crime is that you are suggesting templates , attempting to pattern the thought of voters to superficial norms , playing into the metaphor of a horserace . You have become a demeaning and retarding force , complementing commercial media and ignoring issues in a time of multiple crisis . I have no more patience or mercy for your indulgence in bulls * * t , Bill and Kathleen . You are the magnetic field spinning modern philosophers in their graves . I know Jean Paul Sartre would be spitting at the screen if he could witness your unconcern for the imminent fate of humanity , Monsters ! Posted by : Jack Martin | March 1 , 2008 10:54 AM I have noticed , what I believe , are ads by companies that tell you of their strength in an area of business , but on reflection the co. has had a customer relations problem in that area & is attempting to overcome a mkt . problem . I beilve I have noticed political ads that are designed to allow the hearer to interpet in a way they like , but the candidate can not have their feet held to the fire . For those that make decisions based on ads , it is probably easy to believe that Iowa & New Hampshire should determine the 2 candidates . This may very well be a revolutionary election , not a non white , or non male being elected , but that Fla. Mich. Calif. Texas , etc . realize that their participation in selecting a candidate should always count ! Posted by : Billy Bob | March 1 , 2008 10:49 AM I was struck by the Obama add discussing his family history . In the vein of biography , no only did he wish to disply is ability to overcome , but he seemed to be distancing himself from his father . This could deflect those who latched onto the Keynan/Muslim heritage of his biological father . In essence , defining Obama as American and non-Mulsim . Posted by : David Kays | March 1 , 2008 9:26 AM I was remembering when as a kid I saw the ads and had to watch the local news for history class . They did not have polls therefore no one could 'predict ' the winner . I miss that time . As for thinking Obama is Christ , did you not as a republican espose that same thing about Mr. Bush ? Did not Mr. Bush state that God spoke to him and told him that he needed to President ? Did not you and others tell the rest of us that God spoke to Mr. Bush therefore he was always right and good ? The press is playing up Mr. Obama so do n't blame the ones who are listening to someone who can speak in sentences as playing God for we have that person in office today . But I do n't want someone trying to scare me , have that person in office today . I am still undecided and think hey we have months to go ! I can look at web sites , read articles and make a decision in November . So keep finding fault with Mr. Obama 's name , worry about him being Black or not Black enough , whatever . Worry about if Mrs Clinton can keep Bill away from other women or not . Worry if she can lead this 'great ' country because she is a woman . Worry about Mr. McCain being old , very old and so wanting to be called Mr. President that he flip flop on torture . Here is a man tortured and was against it until he sees that he can be president if he just say all the right things to the right . Hey , I am over here and will vote against you Mr. McCain and I so liked and admired you until now . Get back on that bus , straightness , and be the better person you used to be . Posted by : Brenda | March 1 , 2008 7:33 AM You ask if Americans vote for candidates as people rather than for their `` set of issues '' . Any person with enough incentive to vote has issues , real or imagined . It is , of course , helpful when that voter perceives that the candidate of choice IS , in fact , a person . Can sound bites and 30-second ads sufficiently inform citizens ? That depends on one 's perspective . If you 're the candidate and the voter buys your message then the answer is moot . If you 're a voter , the answer is always no . It 's classic Catch-22 . If a voter is reasonably informed they do n't need the ad . If a voter is n't particularly informed then they do n't have an issue . Thus , political ads highlight made-up and made-for-TV issues . Take a look at Hillary Clinton 's ad concerning a ringing phone at 3AM . What , exactly , does this have to do with reality ? Since when is the president completely isolated from all resources in a crisis ? Is one 's judgement less important in a crisis when it takes place at 3PM ? How ( should ) candidates and issue groups use the media to elevate political discourse ? I find it interesting that we do n't find the concept of `` using the media '' troubling . Having said that , there is no other way than the way they 're already using it . It 's not the candidate 's job to inform the public . It 's the candidate 's job to endear themselves to 50 % + 1 of us . It is the news media 's job to provide us with information and detached analysis . Good luck with that . Bill , you should consider doing a segment on an issue that appears important to the candidates and their target constituency but not the media - NAFTA . In the last debate , the candidates promised to opt out of NAFTA if the agreement could n't be renegotiated . While this plays well with some voters , the ramifications of doing so seem , on the surface , to be significant enough for someone in the media to notice . Nope . So what would the ramifications be if Canada suddenly put tariffs on all the natural gas , oil , pulp and paper , nickel , copper , lumber , etc . that it exports to the US ? What would the valley of the Rio Grande look like without cross-border commerce ? What jobs would disappear from reduced exports to Canada and Mexico ? Would any of those old manufacturing jobs return ? Why am I asking these questions ? ? ?

Clinton has for weeks been bogged down in a two-front war against Trump and Sanders . But since Trump essentially secured his party 's nomination in April , Democrats have grown increasingly anxious that they are running out of precious time to set the terms of the general election before Trump does . `` We ca n't normalize Donald Trump - nothing about him is normal , '' Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Tuesday . Democrats have tried out different strategies to take on the presumptive GOP nominee , but Tuesday , Clinton sent a clear signal to her allies that they should focus on a single message : that Trump pursues profit above all else . The effort was also aimed specifically at voters in battleground states of Ohio , Virginia , Pennsylvania , Florida , New Hampshire , Iowa , Colorado and Nevada . The Washington Post reported earlier this year that in 2005 , Trump ignored growing warnings that the housing market was on shaky ground just before launching his failed mortgage company . Clinton and her surrogates also called attention to Trump 's statements in 2006 and 2007 - in the lead-up to the housing crash in 2008 - saying that if the housing bubble burst , he `` would go in and buy like crazy '' to make money . `` Now he says he wants to roll back the financial regulations that we have imposed on Wall Street to let them run wild again , '' Clinton said . She noted that Trump has `` experience with bankruptcy '' and questioned how he lost money in the casino business . `` He 's bankrupted companies , '' Clinton said . `` I do n't know if that 's one of the qualifications of running for president , but I kind of doubt it .

Too much talk , if you ask some people . Yes , the Republican front runner is a polarizing figure , and has been long before he looked to be a lock for the nomination . Trump 's entrepreneurial spirit and business acumen have made him one of the most well-known tycoons in the world . But not every pursuit has gone smoothly . We decided to take a look at Trump Mortgage , which famously closed after less than two years during the housing crash ( and has been the fodder for much political discourse lately ) , to see what we can learn - and where we can apply cautionary tales to our own real estate-based pursuits . So why did Trump Mortgage fail ? 1 . Because of a grave miscalculation , otherwise known as not listening to the experts Entrepreneurs famously fail because they take chances others wo n't or ca n't . No fault there . But pursing a deal ( or starting a business ) in an environment that is increasingly lacking the support of experts can be folly . `` As some economists and Wall Street traders began to sense danger ahead of the crippling housing market collapse of 2008 , Donald Trump waved away the worries and offered a concrete expression of confidence in the industry , '' said the Washington Post . Trump famously hosted a `` glitzy event '' to kick off the company , which was set up on a floor of his Trump Organization headquarters on Wall Street . The company kicked off with the typical Trump fanfare ; `` Small children were dressed like Donald Trump . People sipped from bottles of water bearing Trump 's likeness , '' said DEALBREAKER . `` Even the Donald seemed stunned . \u2018 If you had told me we would have had this many people for a friggin ' mortgage company opening\u2013give me a break , ' he told the crowd . '' Two years earlier , he had told a CNBC interviewer , `` I think it 's a great time to start a mortgage company , '' said the Post , adding that , `` the real estate market is going to be very strong for a long time to come . '' But within 18 months of opening , the doors to Trump Mortgage were closed . Beyond the questions this failed business naturally raises about a potential Trump presidency , it also presents an opportunity to look at how we do business . Pursuing deals that seem like nonstarters may pan out sometimes . And other times , they 'll leave you with `` some bills unpaid and a spotty sales record , '' not to mention a public who wo n't soon forget about your foibles\u2014especially when you go to run for president . The reality is you do n't get to be a leader on this stage without having a tremendous ego . But believing your own rhetoric is n't always the answer . `` Trump distanced himself from the firm 's demise , saying at the time that he had not been involved in the company 's management and that its executives had performed poorly , '' said The Post . `` As a presidential candidate a decade later , Trump says he would use the skills that made him successful in real estate to fix Washington . His decision to embrace the mortgage business illustrates the potential dangers of a business philosophy that has relied in part on a willingness to put aside the advice of experts and take risks . '' 2 . Bad timing Would Trump Mortgage succeed today ? Conditions are markedly better than they were in 2007\u20132008 , a period that `` ranks among the most horrific in U.S. financial market history\u2026when the major financial markets lost more than 30 % of their value , '' said Investopedia . The mortgage crisis , caused to a large degree by out-of-control subprime mortgages creating massive risk , in conjunction with growing consumer risk , did n't happen all at once ; problems were starting to percolate back in 1999 , when `` the subprime mortgage market expanded , '' they said . `` The higher home prices went , the more creative lenders got in an effort to keeping them going even higher , with a seemingly complete disregard for the potential consequences . '' Once Trump Mortgage launched , with its fearless leader proclaiming to CNBC , `` I think it 's a great time to start a mortgage company .... [ And ] who knows about financing better than I do ? '' the market was already well on its way to tanking . 3 . Not surrounding yourself with the right people We all know the dangers of working with people who are n't who they say they are or who do n't do what they say they 'll do . Being able to trust partners , employees , and vendors is paramount to success in real estate and related industries . In the case of Trump Mortgage , this most basic of business rules was violated by a resume-inflating executive who Trump handpicked to run the company and who , it turns out , was far from qualified to do so . `` The would-be lending powerhouse was done in by timing ( the housing market cratered in 2007 ) and ironically enough , given Trump 's Apprentice TV show , poor hiring , '' said TIME . `` The executive Trump selected to run his loan company , E.J . Ridings , claimed to have been a top executive at a prestigious investment bank . In reality , Ridings ' highest role on Wall Street was as a registered broker , a position he held for a mere six days . '' 4 . Not building strong relationships No real estate professional is an island . Even the best agents and mortgage folks have relationships in place that are mutually beneficial . `` Observers say another reason the company stumbled is that it expanded too quickly , instead of taking the time to build relationships with real estate brokers and lenders , '' said Crains . `` You have to walk before you can run , '' Melissa Cohn , owner and chief executive of Manhattan Mortgage Co. told them . `` You have to do step one before step two , step two before step three -- not just come out with a big splashy ad campaign and rise to the top .

Published Sat , May 28 201612:50 AM EDTUpdated Sat , May 28 20169:06 AM EDTLawrence Kudlow and Stephen Moore , chief economist at the Heritage Foundation WATCH LIVEWe are going to reveal the grand secret to getting rich by investing . It 's a simple formula that has worked for Warren Buffett , Carl Icahn and all the greatest investment gurus over the years . Ready ? Buy low , sell high.It turns out that Donald Trump has been very , very good at buying low and selling high , and it helps account for his amazin business success.But now Hillary Clinton seems to think it 's a crime . Real culprits ? A bank owned sign is seen in front of a foreclosed home.Getty Images Campaigning in California last week she complained that Trump `` actually said he was hoping for the crash that caused hard working families in California and across America to lose their homes , all because he thought he could take advantage of it to make some money for himself . '' She 's assailing Trump for being a good businessman\u2014something she would know almost nothing about because she 's never actually run a business , though she did miraculously turn $ 1,000 into $ 1 million in the cattle futures market many years ago . Hillary 's new TV ads say that Trump predicted the real estate crash in 2006 ( good call ) and then bought real estate at low prices when the housing crash came in 2008 that few others foresaw . Many builders went out of business during the crash , but Trump read the market perfectly . What is so hypocritical about the Clinton attacks is that it was n't Trump , but Hillary , her husband , and many of her biggest supporters who were the real culprits here . Before Hillary is able to rewrite this history , let 's look at the many ways the Clintons and cronies contributed to the Great Recession.Seeds of mortgage meltdownWhy did foreclosures spike in October ? Repossessions spike 66 % as foreclosure crisis lingers The seeds of the mortgage meltdown were planted during Bill Clinton 's presidency.Under Clinton 's Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) secretary , Andrew Cuomo , Community Reinvestment Act regulators gave banks higher ratings for home loans made in `` credit-deprived '' areas . Banks were effectively rewarded for throwing out sound underwriting standards and writing loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting . If banks did n't comply with these rules , regulators reined in their ability to expand lending and deposits . These new HUD rules lowered down payments from the traditional 20 percent to 3 percent by 1995 and zero down-payments by 2000 . What 's more , in the Clinton push to issue home loans to lower income borrowers , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made a common practice to virtually end credit documentation , low credit scores were disregarded , and income and job history was also thrown aside . The phrase `` subprime '' became commonplace . What an understatement . Next , the Clinton administration 's rules ordered the taxpayer-backed Fannie and Freddie to expand their quotas of risky loans from 30 percent of portfolio to 50 percent as part of a big push to expand home ownership . Fannie and Freddie were securitizing these home loans and offering 100 percent taxpayer guarantees of repayment . So now taxpayers were on the hook for these risky , low down-payment loans . Tragically , when prices fell , lower-income folks who really could not afford these mortgages under normal credit standards , suffered massive foreclosures and personal bankruptcies . So many will never get credit again . It 's a perfect example of liberals using government allegedly to help the poor , but the ultimate consequences were disastrous for them . Additionally , ultra-easy money from the Fed also played a key role . Rates were held too low for too long in 2002-2005 , which created asset price bubbles in housing , commodities , gold , oil , and elsewhere . When the Fed finally tightened , prices collapsed . So did mortgage collateral ( homes ) and mortgage bonds that depended on the collateral . Many bond packages were written to please Fannie and Freddie , based on the fantastical idea that home prices would never fall . Fannie and Freddie , by the way , cost the taxpayers $ 187 billion . Just to make this story worse , Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama voted to filibuster a Republican effort to roll back Fannie and Freddie . But on top of all this , while Hillary was propping up Fannie and Freddie , she was taking contributions from their foundations . Plenty of blame to go around A Washington Times investigative report concluded that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae 's political action committee and individuals linked to the companies donated $ 75,500 to Mrs. Clinton 's senatorial campaign . And on top of that , the embattled Clinton Foundation received a $ 50,000 contribution from Freddie Mac , according to the Times . To be clear , there was plenty of blame to go around among both political parties and the horde of housing lobbyists who helped set up this real estate house of cards . It 's a sordid story with plenty of blame all around . And the Fannie/Freddie story is still not solved . It now includes profit sweeping from shareholders to the government , thereby ending any chance to sell the mortgage agencies back to the private sector . Meanwhile , Hillary 's attempt to blame Donald Trump is utterly absurd . Buying low and selling high is not against the law .

One year ago , just 4 % of the public cited any of these issues . The share citing terrorism is the highest it has been since February 2003 . The share of the public now mentioning economic issues is lower than at any point in the last eight years : 23 % today name an economic issue such as the economy ( 9 % ) or unemployment ( 7 % ) as the most important problem facing the nation . In December 2014 , 34 % named an economic issue ; nearly half ( 48 % ) did so two years ago . In the wake of multiple high-profile mass shootings around the country , 5 % of Americans now mention gun control ( 4 % ) or mass shootings ( 2 % ) as the most important problem today . A year ago , 1 % mentioned this as the most important problem . There are wide partisan divides on the most important problem facing the nation . Four-in-ten ( 41 % ) Republicans mention terrorism , defense issues and national security or ISIS , while fewer independents ( 28 % ) and Democrats ( 23 % ) cite these issues . Additionally , Republicans more commonly mention immigration as the most important problem ( 14 % ) than do independents ( 7 % ) or Democrats ( 3 % ) . Democrats are more likely than Republicans to cite partisan gridlock and division in the country ( 8 % of Democrats vs. 2 % of Republicans ) . Views of how the government is handling the terrorist threat Americans \u2019 ratings of the government \u2019 s efforts to reduce the threat of terrorism are now lower than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks . For the first time , more now say the government is doing not too well or not at all well in reducing the threat of terrorism ( 52 % ) than say the government is doing either very or fairly well ( 46 % ) . Positive ratings have fallen 26 points since January ( when 72 % said very/fairly well ) . Compared to early 2015 , assessments of government efforts to combat terrorism are more negative across the political spectrum . Democrats are now the only partisan group in which a majority ( 64 % ) say the government is doing at least fairly well ( down from 85 % in January ) . Independents \u2019 positive ratings have dropped 25 points , from 69 % to 44 % . And just 27 % of Republicans now say the government is doing very or fairly well reducing the terrorist threat , down from 63 % at the beginning of the year . The views of conservative Republicans , in particular , have turned sharply critical : In January , 59 % said the government was doing very well or fairly well ; today , only 18 % say this . Older and less educated Americans are somewhat more likely than younger and more highly educated Americans to give the government low marks for the job it is doing reducing the threat of terrorism . Among those 50 and older , a majority ( 57 % ) say the government is not doing well reducing the terrorist threat ( 42 % say that it is ) . In contrast , 46 % of younger adults ( those 18-29 years old ) give the government \u2019 s performance a negative rating , while 53 % say it is doing very or fairly well . Evaluations of the government \u2019 s job reducing the threat of terrorism are more positive among and those with a postgraduate degree than among other educational groups : 58 % say the government is doing very or fairly well , while 40 % say it is doing not too or not at all well . By comparison , 48 % of those with a bachelor \u2019 s degree , and 44 % of those with less education , rate the government \u2019 s performance positively . By two-to-one , Americans now say that they are more concerned that the government \u2019 s anti-terror policies have not gone far enough to protect the country ( 56 % ) , rather than that these policies have gone too far in restricting the average person \u2019 s civil liberties ( 28 % ) . Since the start of the year , there has been a seven percentage-point rise in the share expressing concern that these policies have not gone far enough . Concern over government restrictions on civil liberties has fallen dramatically since July 2013 , following Edward Snowden \u2019 s leaked details about NSA surveillance programs . At that time , more expressed concern that government policies had gone too far restricting civil liberties ( 47 % ) than that they did not go far enough to protect the country ( 35 % ) . The share expressing greater concern that policies do not go far enough to protect the country is now roughly the same as the historical high seen in early 2010 , shortly after the failed Christmas-Day terrorist attack on an airliner en route to Detroit ( when 58 % said policies did not go far enough ) . Both Republicans and Democrats have become more likely to say that the government \u2019 s anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough to protect the country ( rather than that they have gone too far restricting civil liberties ) since Snowden \u2019 s disclosures in 2013 . But the shift has been more pronounced among Republicans . Slightly more than seven-in-ten Republicans ( 71 % ) now say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies do not go far enough , up 14 points since January ( 57 % ) and 33 points since July 2013 ( 38 % ) . A narrower majority of Democrats ( 54 % ) now say their greater concern is that government policies do not go far enough , up somewhat since January and 16 points since 2013 . Today , similar proportions of conservative Republicans ( 71 % ) , moderate and liberal Republicans ( 74 % ) and conservative and moderate Democrats ( 67 % ) say their greater concern is that anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough . By contrast , equal shares of liberal Democrats say their greater concern is that policies have gone too far in restricting average people \u2019 s civil liberties as say they worry more that these policies have not gone far enough to protect the country ( 41 % each ) . Adults under 30 are split between concerns that U.S. policies place too many restrictions on civil liberties ( 43 % ) and that they do not go far enough to protect the country ( 44 % ) . Majorities in every other age group are more concerned about security than civil liberties , though this concern is more pronounced among those 65 and older ( 71 % say this ) than those 30-49 ( 52 % ) or 50-64 ( 60 % ) . ISIS ranks high as the top global threat to U.S . The Islamic militant group known as ISIS has risen higher atop the public \u2019 s list of global threats to the U.S . Overall , 83 % say ISIS is a major threat to the well-being of the United States , while 13 % say it is a minor threat and just 3 % say it is not a threat . Since August 2014 , the public has become 16 points more likely to view ISIS as a major threat to the U.S. For the public , no other international concern comes close to posing the same level of threat as ISIS . Ranking second on the global threats list is Iran \u2019 s nuclear program : 62 % say this is a major threat to the well-being of the U.S. \u2013 21 points fewer than say the same about ISIS . And while major concern over ISIS is up 16 points from August 2014 , no other concern has seen a significant rise in the share viewing it as a major threat to the U.S. since the summer of 2014 . The survey , which was in the field during the UN climate change conference in Paris , finds 49 % say global climate change is a major threat to the U.S. , little different than the 48 % who said this in August 2014 . Concern over Russia has slipped since August 2014 . Last summer , 53 % viewed growing tension between Russia and its neighbors as a major threat to the U.S . In the current survey , fewer ( 42 % ) say growing authoritarianism in Russia is a major threat .

Does \u2018 Too Little \u2019 to Solve World Problems54 % Say Obama Approach on Foreign Policy Is \u2018 Not Tough Enough \u2019 Survey Report A large majority of Americans think the world is a more dangerous place than it was several years ago . And a terrorist group that was not even on the public \u2019 s radar a year ago \u2013 the Islamic militants known as ISIS or ISIL \u2013 today ranks near the top of its list of U.S. security threats . As the public \u2019 s views of global threats have changed , so too have opinions about America \u2019 s role in solving world problems . On balance , more continue to think the United States does too much , rather than too little , to help solve world problems . But the share saying the U.S. does too little to address global problems has nearly doubled \u2013 from 17 % to 31 % \u2013 since last November , while the percentage saying it is doing too much has fallen from 51 % to 39 % . Republicans , Democrats and independents all are more likely to say the U.S. does too little to solve world problems , but the shift among Republicans has been striking . Last fall , 52 % of Republicans said the U.S. does too much to help solve global problems , while just 18 % said it does too little . Today , 46 % of Republicans think the U.S. does too little to solve global problems , while 37 % say it does too much . The new national survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY , conducted August 20-24 among 1,501 adults , finds that 65 % say the world is more dangerous than it was several years ago ; just 7 % say the world has gotten safer while 27 % say things have not changed much . Public perceptions of the global threats confronting the United States have changed since the Pew Research Center released its major study of foreign policy attitudes \u2013 America \u2019 s Place in the World \u2013 in December 2013 . Currently , 71 % view \u201c Islamic extremist groups like al Qaeda \u201d as a major threat to U.S. well-being , about the same as last year . But nearly as many ( 67 % ) say \u201c the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS , \u201d represents a major threat . The public generally supports U.S. airstrikes against Islamic militants in Iraq . A survey earlier this month by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY found that 54 % approve of airstrikes against the militants while 31 % disapprove . Other ongoing international crises also draw public concern . About half ( 53 % ) regard growing tension between Russia and its neighbors as a major threat to the U.S. Last fall , when asked about growing authoritarianism in Russia , just 32 % viewed that as a major threat . As the death toll from the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa grows , 52 % say the rapid spread of infectious diseases is major threat to the U.S. ; that is about the same percentage that views tensions between Russia and its neighbors as a major threat . Meanwhile , the public expresses less concern about some long-standing foreign policy issues . The percentage rating Iran \u2019 s nuclear program as major threat has fallen by nine points since last November ( from 68 % to 59 % ) , while the share saying North Korea \u2019 s nuclear program is a substantial threat has declined by 10 points ( from 67 % to 57 % ) . And somewhat fewer think that China \u2019 s emergence as a world power poses a major threat to the U.S. than did so last year ( 54 % then , 48 % Public views of U.S. global power continue to be close to a four-decade low , though these opinions also have changed modestly since last fall . Currently , 48 % say the U.S. is a less important and powerful world leader than it was 10 years ago ; 34 % think the U.S. is as important and powerful as it was a decade ago while 15 % think it is more important . In November , 53 % said the U.S. was less important globally , while 27 % said it was as important ( 17 % said it was more important ) . In 2009 , President Obama \u2019 s first year in office , opinions about U.S. global power were more mixed : 41 % said the U.S. was less powerful and important than it was a decade earlier , 30 % about as powerful , while 25 % said the U.S. was more powerful . Obama \u2019 s approach to foreign policy continues to be viewed as not tough enough : 54 % say Obama is not tough enough in his approach on foreign policy and national security issues , while 36 % say his approach is about right and just 3 % say he is too tough . While these opinions are largely unchanged since last fall , in Sept. 2012 , during the presidential campaign , just 41 % said Obama was not tough enough in foreign policy and national Obama \u2019 s overall job rating remains stable : Currently 42 % approve of his job performance while 50 % disapprove . Obama \u2019 s job rating has shown very little change all year . Obama gets his best rating for handling race relations ; nearly half approve of how he is handling race relations ( 48 % ) compared with 42 % who disapprove . His ratings for handling other issues \u2013 including policy toward Israel ( 37 % approve ) , the situation involving Russia and Ukraine ( 35 % ) and the situation in Iraq ( 35 % ) \u2013 are more negative than positive . ( For more on opinions about the Middle East , including views of Obama \u2019 s handling of the situation , see this report . ) Views of U.S . Global Role and Power Since last fall , there have been declines in the percentages of Republicans , Democrats and independents who think the U.S. does too much in the world , while increasing shares of all three groups say it does too little . But the biggest shift in opinion has come among Nearly twice as many Republicans as Democrats now think the United States does too little to help solve world problems ( 46 % vs. 24 % ) . Last fall , there were virtually no partisan differences in these opinions ; just 18 % of Republicans and 15 % of Democrats said the U.S. did too little to solve world problems . Tea Party Republicans \u2019 views of the U.S. role in solving world problems have changed dramatically since last November . Today , 54 % of Republicans and GOP leaners who agree with the Tea Party say it does too little to help solve world problems ; just 33 % say it does too much . Last year , opinions were nearly the reverse : 54 % of Tea Party Republicans said the U.S. did too much global problem-solving while 22 % said it did too little . By contrast , there has been far less change in the opinions of non-Tea Party Republicans . Today , a 46 % plurality of non-Tea Party Republicans say the U.S. does too much to help solve world problems ; last November , 52 % expressed this view", "score": 16.386532528752948}]}, {"question": "Does global warming rank as a top national security threat?", "top_docs": [{"url": "https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2012/01/23/public-priorities-deficit-rising-terrorism-slipping/", "snippet": "Jan 23, 2012 ... ... global warming as a top priority, as did 23% of Republicans.

DONATE Read our research on : Israel | Internet & Technology | Religion Home Research Topics Politics & Policy Political Issues Defense & National Security Terrorism ReportJanuary 23 , 2012 Public Priorities : Deficit Rising , Terrorism SlippingTough Stance on Iran Endorsed Overview As the 2012 State of the Union approaches , the public continues to give the highest priority to economic issues . Fully 86 % say that strengthening the economy should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year , and 82 % rate improving the job situation as a top priority . None of the other 20 issues tested in this annual survey rate as a top priority for more than 70 % of Americans . More generally , the public \u2019 s concerns rest more with domestic policy than at any point in the past 15 years ; 81 % say Obama should be focused on domestic policy , just 9 % say foreign policy . In keeping with this , defending against terrorism and strengthening the military are given less priority today than over the course of the past decade . Nonetheless , the public is keeping a wary eye on Iran . It is now seen as the country that represents the greatest danger to the U.S. , and more Americans prioritize taking a firm stand against Iran over avoiding military conflict . And with respect to restructuring America \u2019 s national security policy , the public is evenly divided as to whether a smaller military can be just as effective as a larger one in facing future security challenges . Shifting GOP Priorities The new poll finds that the federal budget deficit stands out as the fastest growing policy priority for Americans , largely because of growing Republican concerns about the issue . In the national survey , conducted Jan. 11-16 among 1,502 adults , 69 % rate reducing the budget deficit as a top priority \u2013 the most in any of the Pew Research Center \u2019 s annual policy priority updates going back to 1994 . The number of Republicans rating the budget deficit as a top priority has spiked to 84 % from 68 % a year ago and just 42 % five years ago . Meanwhile Republicans are placing far less emphasis on terrorism , which was their top priority in every year between 2002 and 2008 . Today 72 % rate it as a top priority , down from 83 % a year ago and 93 % five years ago . By contrast , the emphasis Democrats and independents give to terrorism and the budget deficit has changed far less . Parties Divide on Medicare , Health Care Making the Social Security and Medicare systems financially sound continue to be top-tier issues for Americans , with 68 % and 61 % rating them as top priorities , respectively . There is a substantially larger partisan divide over Medicare , which Democrats view as higher priority than do Republicans , than over Social Security . Reducing health care costs remains one of the more divisive issues politically , as it was even before the recent battle over health care reform . Currently , 71 % of Democrats rate it as a top priority , compared with just 49 % of Republicans . Energy and Environment No issue divides partisans more than the importance of environmental protection \u2013 58 % of Democrats say it is a top priority , compared with just 27 % of Republicans . Of the 22 items tested , environmental protection is one of the lowest GOP priorities , along with such issues as improving transportation infrastructure and campaign finance reform . Dealing with the nation \u2019 s energy problems , by contrast , is of equal importance to both Republicans ( 55 % top priority ) and Democrats ( 57 % ) , though other recent surveys suggest that partisans have very different solutions in mind . Since it was first tested on the annual policy priorities list in 2007 , the share of Americans who view dealing with global warming as a top priority has slipped from 38 % to 25 % . Democrats ( 38 % ) are far more likely than Republicans ( 11 % ) to rate this as a top priority . But the decline has occurred across party lines : In 2007 , 48 % of Democrats rated dealing with global warming as a top priority , as did 23 % of Republicans . Money and Politics Despite a recent focus on the issue of money in politics , including the role of Super PACs in the 2012 Republican primaries , the issue remains on the back burner for most Americans . Just 28 % say reforming the campaign finance system is a top priority for the president and Congress in 2012 , and it is one of the lowest ranked issues across party lines . Somewhat more ( 40 % ) say reducing the influence of lobbyists and special interest groups in Washington is a top priority . There has been little change in the public \u2019 s focus on either issue compared with previous years . Declining Focus on Immigration The share of Americans ranking illegal immigration as a top priority has fallen to 39 % from 46 % a year ago and 55 % in 2007 . This decline has occurred across party lines , with a notable drop among Republicans . In 2007 , illegal immigration was the second-highest priority after terrorism for Republicans , with 69 % rating it as a top priority . Today , 48 % of Republicans rate it as a top priority , placing it behind 11 other priorities . Tax Fairness a Low GOP Priority About six-in-ten Americans ( 61 % ) say that making the tax system more fair should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year . It ranks among the top 10 issue priorities , well above items like immigration or the environment , and nearly on par with perennially top-tier issues like education ( 65 % top priority ) . Democrats and independents rate this as a more critical issue than do Republicans , but half of Republicans say this should be a top priority in 2012 . About two-thirds of Americans with household incomes under $ 75,000 rate this as a top priority , compared with about half of those earning $ 75,000 or more . Iran a Top Concern The recent tensions over Iran \u2019 s nuclear program and disputes between the U.S. and Iran in the Persian Gulf have garnered a good deal of public attention . Roughly four-in-ten ( 42 % ) say they have heard a lot about this , and 41 % have heard a little . The percentage naming Iran as the country posing the greatest danger to the U.S. has more than doubled to 28 % from 12 % a year ago , and it now ranks slightly higher than China . Of those following the Iran situation , 54 % say the U.S. should take a firm stand against Iran \u2019 s actions , while 39 % say it is more important to avoid a military conflict with Iran . On Afghanistan , the public favors removing U.S. troops as soon as possible by a wide 56 % to 38 % margin . Obama continues to receive highly favorable marks for his handling of Afghanistan , and more approve than disapprove of his handling of Iran as well .

'' `` Even as we meet threats like terrorism , '' he said , `` we can not , and we must not , ignore a peril that can affect generations . '' This is not the first time the federal government has characterized climate change as a security threat . The fact sheet distributed by the administration yesterday quotes reports going back to 2008 . And as Philip Bump writes in the Washington Post , the rhetorical effort to link climate to security goes all the way back to Bill Clinton . Each time it comes up , large swaths of the media treat it as a bold new argument , which is probably a good sign that despite all the efforts , it 's still not a natural , instinctive connection for most people . It sounds novel . Still , Obama 's speech was the clearest articulation of the argument to date . So what should we make of the claim ? Does climate change threaten our national security ? What does that even mean , exactly ? It 's complicated . I 've been thinking about this on and off for several years now , and I 've come to four conclusions . ( A top five list would have been more satisfying , but it turns out I only know four things . ) 1 ) Climate change is a threat ; whether it 's a `` national security threat '' is a matter of semantics Brad Plumer wrote yesterday about an IMF report that uses the word `` subsidy '' in a slightly novel way , to refer to money not charged to fossil fuel companies to pay for the environmental and health damages of their products . Brad asked , Is that a good way to use the word ? And that 's the right question . Language evolves ; familiar words and concepts expand or take on new meanings . There 's no right answer to whether an uncharged tax `` really is '' a subsidy . It is if we choose to use the word `` subsidy '' that way . The question is whether viewing the phenomenon through that lens is useful , whether it clarifies or illuminates . Something similar is going on in calling climate change a national security threat . It 's best seen not as a neutral description of the world ( there is no such thing ) but as a kind of conceptual gambit , an attempt to change the way we think \u2014 about climate change and about national security . Certainly climate change is n't like other things we think of as security threats . It wo n't invade a neighboring country or plant a bomb on a plane . It has no intentions , no volition , no ill will . It is not even an `` it , '' really , so much as a statistical trend . Instead , climate change is a `` threat multiplier '' that can , in the fact sheet 's words , `` exacerbate existing stressors , contributing to poverty , environmental degradation , and political instability , providing enabling environments for terrorist activity abroad . '' These refugees from Boko Haram probably do n't blame climate change for the circumstances that gave rise to that terrorist group . ( Photo by Mohammed Elshamy/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images ) Climate change does n't directly cause , say , armed conflicts . It raises the probability of armed conflicts , by increasing the likelihood of drought , water and food shortages , and forced migrations . It remains to be seen whether this gambit will be politically effective . Lots of people have high hopes for this messaging \u2014 and have for a long while \u2014 but whatever its effects inside the military , it has n't changed the political valence of the climate issue in any discernible way . Republican reaction to the president 's speech amounted to mockery and repeated invocations of ISIS . `` Our adversaries are not motivated by the weather ; they are emboldened by America 's withdrawal from the world , '' said Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas . Sigh . Turns out it 's easy to get people riled up about threats with scary faces , but getting them riled up about probabilities is a bit more difficult . Then again , messages change things , if at all , not through cleverness but through repetition , so it remains to be seen whether there 's any long-term shift in public opinion on this . 2 ) The US military will mostly deal with climate change preparation and response ( a.k.a . `` adaptation '' ) Obama 's primary message was that all branches of the military , including the Coast Guard , need to prepare for a warmer planet and a more volatile geopolitics . Especially in poor and low-lying areas of the world , climate impacts will put new strains on military resources . The US armed forces will be called upon to join peacemaking and humanitarian missions in the wake of resource-driven conflicts and weather-related disasters . They will need to reinforce or relocate military bases , both domestic and international , that are located near coasts . They will be mobilized to protect Arctic resources newly uncovered by melting ice . We think of security threats as something we fight , but none of this will look , on the ground , like fighting climate change . It will look like coping with a fractious world , as the US military has done for decades . The climate change threat will mostly be visible as a statistical trend , a rise in the number of disruptions . US Army helicopters deliver aid to Nepal after the recent earthquake . ( SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP/Getty Images ) 3 ) Prevention ( a.k.a . `` mitigation '' ) is an ineffective national security tool The tricky pivot in Obama 's speech \u2014 and in the climate-as-national-security message generally \u2014 is from preparation and response to prevention ( or `` mitigation , '' as it 's opaquely known ) . That climate impacts will generate sociopolitical unrest makes sense ; that the military will be called on to respond to unrest makes sense ; that it should prepare in advance for that task makes sense . The more difficult case to make is that the military ought to be involved in reducing its own emissions \u2014 not just responding to climate impacts , but also helping prevent ( some of ) them . This is where Republicans are attacking , where they think the greening of the military appears `` ideological '' and thus vulnerable . Last year , the GOP House of Representatives stuck an amendment onto the National Defense Authorization Act specifying that", "score": 10.885621178672762}, {"url": "https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/20/remarks-president-united-states-coast-guard-academy-commencement", "snippet": "May 20, 2015 ... ...

( Laughter . ) Whenever I visit our military bases , there are always lots of soldiers and sailors and airmen and Marines . They make a lot of noise . But wherever I am -- across the country or around the world , including Afghanistan -- nowhere near an ocean -- the most determined cheer from the crowd comes from our proud Coast Guardsmen , because usually there might only be one or two of them . ( Laughter . ) As Paul mentioned , in my State of the Union address this year , I mentioned how I \u2019 ve seen America at its best when commissioning our new officers , including here in New London . And it 's true , some folks across the country didn \u2019 t quite get the reference . One person tweeted that they were pretty sure I just made this up . ( Applause . ) Then there was one person in town who asked , \u201c Did Obama name drop New London ? \u201d So let me do it again . It is a great honor to be back in New London , at the United States Coast Guard Academy -- ( applause ) -- to salute the newest ensigns of America \u2019 s oldest , continuous maritime service . ( Applause . ) Cadets , this is a day to celebrate all that you \u2019 ve achieved over these past four years . You have excelled at one of the most selective and rigorous academic institutions in America . You \u2019 ve held yourselves to a high code of conduct , proven yourself worthy to be called commissioned officers in the United States Coast Guard . You pushed yourselves physically -- from Swab Summer to beating your officers at basketball and softball and football . ( Applause . ) You braced up , squared your meals , spent Friday nights waxing the floors -- maybe a little \u201c Rodeo Buffing. \u201d ( Laughter . ) I saw the video . That looks dangerous , by the way . ( Laughter . ) You made your mark , and you will be remembered . In Chase Hall . In this stadium . And at Hanafin \u2019 s and Bulkeley House . ( Applause . ) Which reminds me , in keeping with longstanding tradition , I hereby absolve all cadets serving restrictions for minor offenses . ( Laughter . ) Minor offenses . You came together as one team . We are joined today by Commander Merle Smith -- the first African American graduate of this Academy -- ( applause ) -- Class of 1966 , a decorated Vietnam veteran . His legacy endures in all of you -- because the graduating Class of 2015 is the most diverse in Academy history . And you took care of each other , like family . Today we honor the memory of your classmate from the Republic of Georgia , Soso , along with Beso . Their spirits will live on in the partnerships you forge with Coast Guards all over the world . Today , you take your rightful place in the Long Blue Line . For Marina Stevens and her family , it is a very long line . Where is Marina ? Just wave at me real quick . There she is right there . Marina \u2019 s dad is Coast Guard civilian . Her mom , Janet , an Academy graduate , was a Coast Guard captain and will pin on Marina \u2019 s shoulder boards today . Marina \u2019 s grandfather was a Coast Guardsman . Her great-grandfather joined the U.S. Lighthouse Service in 1918 . That \u2019 s four generations , spanning nearly the entire life of the modern Coast Guard . No wonder she \u2019 s named Marina . ( Laughter and applause . ) It \u2019 s in her blood . And , Cadets , I know that none of you reached this day alone . So join me in giving a huge round of applause to your mentors and your incredible parents and your family members -- so many of them , themselves , veterans as well . Please give them a big round of applause . ( Applause . ) Class of 2015 , I \u2019 m here as your Commander-in-Chief , on behalf of the American people , to say thanks to each of you . Thanks for choosing to serve -- for stepping up , for giving up the comforts of civilian life , for putting on that uniform . Thank you for the service you are about to render -- the life of purpose that you \u2019 ve embraced , the risks that you \u2019 ve accepted and the sacrifices that you will make . But I \u2019 m not here to just sing your praises . I want to speak to you about what comes next . Soon , you \u2019 ll fan out across the Coast Guard and some of you will go to sectors and shore command . Some of you will start your duty aboard cutters . Some of you will start flight training . America needs you . And we need the Coast Guard more than ever . We need you to safeguard our ports against all threats , including terrorism . We need you to respond in times of disaster or distress and lead your rescue teams as they jump out of perfectly good helicopters . We need you in the Caribbean and Central America , interdicting drugs before they reach our streets and damage our kids . We need you in the Middle East ; in the Gulf ; alongside our Navy ; in places like West Africa , where you helped keep the ports open so that the world could fight a deadly disease . We need you in the Asia Pacific , to help our partners train their own coast guards to uphold maritime security and freedom of navigation in waters vital to our global economy . These are all demanding missions . The pace of operations is intense . And these are tight fiscal times for all our services , including the Coast Guard . But we are going to keep working to give you the boats and the cutters and the aircraft that you need to complete the missions we ask of you . We \u2019 re moving ahead with new Fast Response Cutters , new Offshore Patrol Cutters . We \u2019 re on track to have a full fleet of new National Security Cutters -- the most advanced in history . And I \u2019 ve made it clear that I will not accept a budget that continues these draconian budget cuts called sequestration , because our nation and our military and our Coast Guard deserve better . ( Applause . ) And this brings me to the challenge I want to focus on today -- one where our Coast Guardsmen are already on the front lines , and that , perhaps more than any other , will shape your entire careers -- and that \u2019 s the urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change . As a nation , we face many challenges , including the grave threat of terrorism . And as Americans , we will always do everything in our power to protect our country . Yet even as we meet threats like terrorism , we can not , and we must not , ignore a peril that can affect generations . Now , I know there are still some folks back in Washington who refuse to admit that climate change is real . And on a day like today , it \u2019 s hard to get too worried about it . There are folks who will equivocate . They \u2019 ll say , \u201c You know , I \u2019 m not a scientist. \u201d Well , I \u2019 m not either . But the best scientists in the world know that climate change is happening . Our analysts in the intelligence community know climate change is happening . Our military leaders -- generals and admirals , active duty and retired -- know it \u2019 s happening . Our homeland security professionals know it is happening . And our Coast Guard knows it \u2019 s happening . The science is indisputable . The fossil fuels we burn release carbon dioxide , which traps heat . And the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are now higher than they have been in 800,000 years . The planet is getting warmer . Fourteen of the 15 hottest years on record have been in the past 15 years .

It wasn \u2019 t nuclear weapons in rogue states either . \u201c No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change , \u201d said Obama in his State of the Union speech Tuesday . His statement was met with scattered , muted applause . The United States should lead in international efforts to protect \u201c the one planet we \u2019 ve got , \u201d he said . 2014 was the warmest year since record keeping began . \u201c One year doesn \u2019 t make a trend , \u201d he said . \u201c But this does \u2013 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. \u201d But American commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming has been intermittent throughout the years . The United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol , a binding agreement in 1997 to cut greenhouse gas emissions . A 2007 U.N. climate change conference ended with anger at the United States , then under the Bush administration , when it balked at binding carbon cuts . \u201c We were used to having U.S. as a pariah , \u201d said Liz Gallagher , the program leader of climate diplomacy at E3G , an environmental group . bts obama turn the page sotu_00002810.jpg CNN video Obama : 'Tonight we turn the page ' Environmentalist noted a shift in recent years under Obama , including a recent agreement with China to reduce emissions . \u201c It \u2019 s better to have America inside the game than outside . It makes it easier to persuade everyone else , \u201d said Gallagher . Critical year for climate change policy The U.S. remains the second greatest polluter , behind China . In a historic climate change deal in November , Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that both countries would curb their greenhouse gas emissions over the next two decades . The two countries account for over one third of global greenhouse gas emissions . \u201c Because the world \u2019 s two largest economies came together , other nations are now stepping up , and offering hope that , this year , the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we \u2019 ve got , \u201d Obama said during his speech .

Among those who heard at least a little about the nuclear talks , just 33 % say they think Iranian leaders are serious about addressing international concerns about the country \u2019 s nuclear enrichment program , while 60 % say they are not . Members of the Council on Foreign Relations have more positive views of Iranian leaders \u2019 intentions . Still , just half ( 50 % ) of the organization \u2019 s members say Iranian leaders are serious about addressing concerns over its nuclear program , while 44 % disagree . Among the public , there are partisan differences over whether Iranian leaders are serious about addressing concerns over the country \u2019 s nuclear program . Majorities of Republicans ( 73 % ) and independents ( 62 % ) who have heard at least a little about the nuclear talks say Iranian leaders are not serious in addressing nuclear concerns . Democrats who have heard about this issue offer more mixed evaluations ; 42 % say Iranian leaders are serious and 48 % say they are not . Iran \u2019 s nuclear program continues to be one of the top global threats to the United States in the public \u2019 s view . Nearly seven-in-ten Americans ( 68 % ) say that Iran \u2019 s nuclear program is a major threat to the well-being of the United States , which is changed only modestly from America \u2019 s Place in the World surveys in 2009 and 2005 . Views of other long-standing global threats , such as Islamic extremist groups like al Qaeda ( 75 % major threat ) , North Korea \u2019 s nuclear program ( 68 % ) and China \u2019 s emergence as a world power ( 54 % ) , also have changed little in recent years . However , the public now is deeply concerned by an emerging security threat , possible cyber-attacks against the United States . Seven-in-ten ( 70 % ) say that cyber-attacks represent a major threat , placing this on par with Islamic extremist groups and Iran \u2019 s nuclear ambitions . In terms of China and Russia , in particular , the public does not view either country very favorably \u2013 just 33 % have a favorable opinion of China while 32 % view Russia favorably . Yet there is no evidence of growing public alarm about either China or Russia . Only about one-in-five Americans ( 23 % ) regard China as an adversary , while 43 % see the country as a serious problem but not an adversary ; 28 % say China is not much of a problem . That opinion has held fairly steady for more than a decade . Similarly , relatively few ( 18 % ) view Russia as an adversary ; 36 % say Russia is a serious problem but not an adversary and 40 % think the country is not much of a problem . When asked which country represents the greatest danger to the United States , identical percentages volunteer Iran and China ( 16 % ) . Nearly one-in-ten ( 9 % ) say that the United States itself represents the greatest danger , while 7 % each cite North Korea and Iraq . Public \u2019 s Top Foreign Policy Priorities : Terrorism and Jobs As in the past , many leading foreign policy priorities reflect domestic concerns . While 83 % say that protecting the United States from terrorist attacks should be a top long-range foreign policy goal , about as many ( 81 % ) rate protecting the jobs of American workers as a top priority . Majorities also say that reducing the country \u2019 s dependence on imported energy sources ( 61 % ) and combating international drug trafficking ( 57 % ) should be top priorities , while nearly half say the same about reducing illegal immigration ( 48 % ) . Many of the public \u2019 s domestically oriented goals are not shared by most members of the Council on Foreign Relations : Just 29 % say protecting the jobs of American workers should be top policy priority , compared with 81 % of the public . And only about one-in-ten CFR members ( 11 % ) sees reducing illegal immigration as a top long-range policy goal ; 48 % of the public views reducing illegal immigration as a top priority . Climate change stands out as an issue of greater priority to CFR members than the public : A majority of the organization \u2019 s members ( 57 % ) say that dealing with global climate change should be a top foreign policy goal , compared with 37 % of the public . Promoting human rights abroad , helping improve living standards in developing countries and promoting democracy rate as relatively low priorities for both the public and CFR members . These views have changed only modestly in recent years . Perceptions of U.S . Global Power In the public \u2019 s view , China long ago surpassed the United States as the world \u2019 s top economic power . In the new survey , 48 % say China is the world \u2019 s leading economic power while just 31 % say it is the United States . That is little changed from recent years . Yet , most Americans ( 68 % ) continue to say that the United States is the world \u2019 s leading military power . Just 14 % think China has overtaken the United States in military strength . In general terms , however , an increasing share of Americans think that the United States plays a less important and powerful role as world leader than it did 10 years ago . Currently 53 % see the U.S. as a less powerful world leader , up from 41 % in 2009 . Members of the Council on Foreign Relations also believe that U.S. power has declined . A majority of the organization \u2019 s members ( 62 % ) express this view , compared with 44 % in 2009 . Partisanship is a major factor in changing public opinion about U.S. global power . Nearly three-quarters of Republicans ( 74 % ) say the United States plays a less important and powerful role than it did 10 years ago , up from 50 % four years ago and just 8 % in July 2004 . Yet , the percentage of political independents who view the U.S. as less powerful also has grown , from 23 % in 2004 to 45 % in 2009 and 55 % today . Democrats \u2019 views have changed little over this period ; in the current survey , 33 % of Democrats say the U.S. is less powerful than it was a decade ago . Partisan differences are not as pronounced in opinions about whether the United States is respected internationally . Majorities of Republicans ( 80 % ) , independents ( 74 % ) and Democrats ( 56 % ) say the United States is less respected by other nations than in in the past . In contrast with attitudes about America \u2019 s global power , there is more partisan agreement that the United States should be less active internationally . About half of independents ( 55 % ) and Republicans ( 53 % ) and 46 % of Democrats say the United States should mind its own business internationally . In 2002 , following the 9/11 attacks , 27 % of independents , 22 % of Republicans and 40 % of Democrats wanted the United States to mind its own business internationally . Obama and Foreign Policy Barack Obama \u2019 s overall job approval rating has fallen over the past year , and he gets low ratings for his handling of number of foreign policy issues . His job rating is below 40 % for nine of 10 foreign policy issues tested , including his overall handling of the nation \u2019 s foreign policy .

JOHN\u00a0...", "title": "Climate of Doubt | FRONTLINE", "segment": "JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ voice-over ] These political messengers rely on a small group of outspoken scientific contrarians , like climatologist Pat Michaels of the libertarian Cato Institute . PATRICK J. MICHAELS , Cato Institute : Every paragraph can be contested . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Willie Soon is an astrophysicist who studies the sun and stars . WILLIE SOON : \u2014mechanism to transport anything from the tropics to the arctic\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : And Fred Singer , the veteran scientist at these proceedings . He 's a retired physicist once responsible for government weather satellites , who tells people the climate needs no help from worried humans . FRED SINGER , Founder , Science and Env . Policy Project : Climate , to me , has become a non-issue . It 's a phantom issue . There 's nothing wrong with climate . It will change no matter what we do . It 'll get colder . It 'll get warmer . We just have to wait a little . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Singer says he 's dedicated to explaining his theories about global warming . [ on camera ] What keeps you going ? What 's your motivation ? FRED SINGER : Basically , I like to see good science being done and protected . I think I 'm fighting here for scientific truth . That 's important to me . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Do you think the science is being hyped on global warming ? FRED SINGER : Oh , very definitely , yes . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ voice-over ] Armed with that conviction , this team of skilled political messengers and contrarians has certainly changed the game . In just four years , the number of Americans who agree global warming is manmade has dropped to about half . It 's a message that is inspiring a new generation of skeptics . CONFERENCE GOER : I would like to really listen to these scientists who came and talked and have dedicated their lives to debunking this fallacy , so to speak . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Once upon a time , what these people call a fallacy had another name , the truth . AL GORE , Fmr . Vice Pres . : [ `` Inconvenient Truth '' ] You 've heard of off the charts . Within less than 50 years , it 'll be here . The so-called skeptics\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : In 2006 , the film An Inconvenient Truth told a disturbing story and galvanized public awareness about the climate . BRIAN WILLIAMS , NBC News : And now to a new report on global warming from a prestigious panel of scientists convened by the U.N.\u2014 WOLF BLITZER , CNN : There 's a new grim report out today from\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : This comprehensive report in 2007 took it to another level . Scientists from 30 nations concluded that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is mostly the cause . SAM CHAMPION , ABC News Weather Editor : It is the definitive report on global warming , and it 's frightening . NOBEL CEREMONY : I call upon the Peace Prize laureate for 2007 , Al Gore , to come forward\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : The U.N. scientists and former vice president Al Gore would share the Nobel Peace Prize . The cause had a consensus and a credible leader . The skeptics would take on both . JAMES TAYLOR : I think Al Gore was probably the best thing that could happen to global warming skeptics . MYRON EBELL : From my perspective , Al Gore was the perfect proponent and leader of the global warming alarmists because he 's very politically divisive and controversial . TIM PHILLIPS , Pres. , Americans for Prosperity : I think it was his tone and manner . He did at a certain point come across as holier than thou . And that 's another thing about Americans . They 're not really big on holier than thou . SEAN HANNITY , Fox News Channel : Now , that is a G2-V aircraft\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Personalizing the attacks was part of an approach that was immediately embraced and amplified by friendly media . SEAN HANNITY : And that is the former vice president getting off that plane , into a Town Car , by the way , not a hybrid ! CHRIS HORNER , Competitive Enterprise Institute : He equates the failure to recycle aluminum cans with the Holocaust ! MYRON EBELL , Competitive Enterprise Institute : He wants to be a superhero action figure . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Myron Ebell was acting on a broad strategy he helped create more than a decade ago . In this 1998 action plan , `` Victory will be achieved , '' it said , when the public `` recognizes uncertainties in climate science . '' Today at the Washington , D.C. , headquarters of the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a free market think tank , you can see Myron Ebell 's philosophy proudly displayed on the walls . MYRON EBELL : They 're all CEI authors . What we 're fighting is the expansion of government . And there are many pretexts for expanding government . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Opposing government action on climate change to defend American freedom is a perfect fit . MYRON EBELL : We felt that if you concede the science is settled and that there 's a consensus , you can not \u2014 the moral high ground has been ceded to the alarmists . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ on camera ] So you had to go to work and break down this consensus . MYRON EBELL : Yes . And we did it because we believed that the consensus was phony . We believed that the so-called global warming consensus was not based on science , but was a political consensus , which included a number of scientists . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ voice-over ] In 2009 , agreement on global warming seemed part of the solid wave of enthusiasm that elected Barack Obama . With the changing of the guard in Washington , there was a bipartisan call to action , a sense of inevitability . HOUSE SERGEANT AT ARMS : Madam Speaker , the president of the United States ! JOHN HOCKENBERRY : An idea that for years had struggled for attention in Congress would get its moment of truth . Pres . BARACK OBAMA : So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : The president backed the so-called cap-and-trade approach , a system of regulations and financial incentives to eventually reduce the emission of carbon into the atmosphere . [ on camera ] It seemed there was consensus on climate change . Sen. JOHN KERRY ( D ) , Massachusetts : There was an uneasy consensus , but the people who have always objected to change had not yet really engaged . And because of the consensus , because there was a sense that there was going to be movement , that galvanized the action of the people who oppose it . MYRON EBELL : The American people had n't focused on these issues until it actually came to a vote in Congress on a bill to implement these policies . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : [ voice-over ] The soft consensus for taking action ran into the bitter partisan divisions in Congress . Congressional hearings on cap-and-trade would become a stage where opposing views would get equal time . Rep. EDWARD MARKEY ( D-MA ) , Chair , Subcmt . on Energy & Environment : Professor Schrag , you 've just heard what Dr. Michaels said\u2014 JOHN HOCKENBERRY : Pro cap-and-trade lawmakers would call leading climate scientists and policy makers to make the argument for action now . Prof. DANIEL SCHRAG , Earth and Planetary Sciences , Harvard Univ . : It 's very clear from that estimate that , in fact , we 're in for bigger trouble . THOMAS R. KARL , Dir. , NOAA 's National Climatic Data Center : One of the things that we 've already seen is many observed changes in the climate\u2014 Gen. GORDON R. SULLIVAN ( Ret . ) , Assn . of the United States Army : Global climate change is a serious threat to our national security . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : The skeptics had their own witnesses . They testified that nothing was settled and that global warming might actually be good for the planet . Rep. JOHN SHIMKUS ( R ) , Illinois : Say that again ? Carbon dioxide is what ? CHRISTOPHER MONCKTON : It 's plant food . Rep. JOHN SHIMKUS : It 's plant food . CHRISTOPHER MONCKTON : Yes . JOHN HOCKENBERRY : The testimony of the skeptics argued for a timeout .
